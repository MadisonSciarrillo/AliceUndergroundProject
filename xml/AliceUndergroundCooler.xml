    <heading> Chapter I </heading> 
    <p> Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having
      nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had
      no pictures or conversations in it, and where is the use of a book, thought Alice, without
      pictures or conversations? So she was considering in her own mind, (as well as she could, for
      the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid,) whether the pleasure of making a
      daisy-chain was worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when a white rabbit
      with pink eyes ran close by her. </p>
    <p> There was nothing very remarkable in that, nor did Alice think it so very much out of the
      way to hear <char>the rabbit</char> say to itself "dear, dear! I shall be too late!" (when she thought it
      over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time
      it all seemed quite natural); but when <char>the rabbit</char> actually <uline>took a watch out of
        its waistcoat-pocket</uline>, looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet,
        for it flashed across her
      mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket or a watch to take
      out of it, and, full of curiosity, she hurried across the field after it, and was just in time
      to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge. In a moment down went Alice after it,
      never once considering how in the world she was to get out again. </p>
    <p> <char>the rabbit</char>-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down,
      so suddenly, that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself, before she found
      herself falling down what seemed a deep well. Either the well was very deep, or she fell very
      slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her, and to wonder what
      would happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it
      was too dark to see anything: then, she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they
      were filled with cupboards and book-shelves: here and there were maps and pictures hung on
      pegs. She took a jar down off one of the shelves as she passed: it was labelled "Orange Marmalade," but to her
      great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar, for fear of killing
      somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it. </p>
    <p> "Well!" thought Alice to herself, "after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of
      tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything
      about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!" (which was most likely true.) </p>
    <p> Down, down, down. Would the fall <uline>never</uline> come to an end? "I wonder how
      many miles I've fallen by this time?" she said aloud, "I must be getting somewhere near the
      centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—" (for you
      see Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though
      this was not a <uline>very</uline> good opportunity of showing off her knowledge, as
      there was no one to hear her, still it was good practice to say it over,) "yes that's the
      right distance, but then what Longitude or Latitude-line shall I be in?" (Alice had no
        idea what Longitude was, or
      Latitude either, but she thought they were nice grand words to say.) </p>
    <p> Presently she began again: "I wonder if I shall fall right <uline>through</uline>
      the earth! How funny it'll be to come out among the people that walk with their heads
      downwards! But I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please,
      Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?"—and she tried to curtsey as she spoke (fancy <uline>curtseying</uline> as you're falling through the air! do you think you could manage
      it?) "and what an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to ask:
      perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere." </p>
    <p> Down, down, down: there was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. "<char>Dinah</char>
      will miss me very much tonight, I should think!" (<char>Dinah</char> was the cat.) "I hope they'll remember
      her saucer of milk at tea-time! Oh, dear <char>Dinah</char>, I wish I had you here! There are no mice in
      the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know, my
      dear. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?" And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and kept on
      saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way "do cats eat bats? do cats eat bats?" and
        sometimes, "do bats eat
      cats?" for, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter which way she put
      it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in
      hand with <char>Dinah</char>, and was saying to her very earnestly, "Now, <char>Dinah</char>, my dear, tell me the
      truth. Did you ever eat a bat?" when suddenly, bump! bump! down she came upon a heap of sticks
      and shavings, and the fall was over. </p>
    <p> Alice was not a bit hurt, and jumped on to her feet directly: she looked up, but it was all
      dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the white rabbit was still in sight,
      hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and just
      heard it say, as it turned a corner, "my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!" She turned
      the corner after it, and instantly found herself in a long, low hall, lit up by a row of lamps
      which hung from the roof. </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_006.jpg"/>  
    <p> There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked, and when Alice had been all
      round it, and tried them all, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again: suddenly
      she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing lying
      upon it, but a tiny golden key, and Alice's first idea was that it might belong to one of the
      doors of the hall, but alas! either the locks were too large, or the key too small, but at any
      rate it would open none of them. However, on the second time round, she came to a low curtain,
      behind which was a door about eighteen inches high: she tried the little key in the keyhole,
      and it fitted! Alice opened the door, and looked down a small passage, not larger than a
      rat-hole, into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall,
      and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could
      not even get her head through the doorway, "and even if my head would go through," thought
      poor Alice, "it would be very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I
      think I could, if I only knew how to begin." For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had
      happened lately, that Alice began to think very few things indeed were really impossible. </p>
    <p> There was nothing else to do, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find
      another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting up people like telescopes: this
      time there was a little bottle on it—"which certainly was not there before" said Alice—and
      tied round the neck of the bottle was a paper label with the words <b>DRINK ME</b> beautifully
      printed on it in large letters. </p>
    <p> It was all very well to say "drink me," "but I'll look first," said the wise little Alice,
      "and see whether the bottle's marked "poison" or not," for Alice had read several nice little
      stories about children that got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts, and other unpleasant
      things, because they <uline>would</uline> not remember the simple rules their friends
      had given them, such as, that, if you get into the fire, it will burn you, and that, if you
      cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it generally bleeds, and she had never forgotten that, if you drink a
      bottle marked "poison," it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later. </p>
    <p> However, this bottle was <uline>not</uline> marked poison, so Alice tasted it, and
      finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard,
      pine-apple, roast turkey, toffy, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off. </p>

    <p> "What a curious feeling!" said Alice, "I must be shutting up like a telescope." </p>
    <p> It was so indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up as it
      occurred to her that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that
      lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see whether she was going to
      shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this, "for it might end, you know," said
      Alice to herself, "in my going out altogether, like a candle, and what should I be like then,
      I wonder?" and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown
        out, for she could not
      remember having ever seen one. However, nothing more happened so she decided on going into the
      garden at once, but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had
      forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for the key, she found
      she could not possibly reach it: she could see it plainly enough through the glass, and she
      tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery, and when she
      had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried. </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_009.jpg"/>
    <p> "Come! there's no use in crying!" said Alice to herself rather sharply, "I advise you to
      leave off this minute!" (she generally gave herself very good advice, and sometimes scolded
      herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes, and once she remembered boxing her own
      ears for having been unkind to herself in a game of croquet she was playing with herself, for this curious child
      was very fond of pretending to be two people,) "but it's no use now," thought poor Alice, "to
      pretend to be two people! Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make one respectable
      person!" </p>
    <p> Soon her eyes fell on a little ebony box lying under the table: she opened it, and found in
      it a very small cake, on which was lying a card with the words <b>EAT ME</b> beautifully
      printed on it in large letters. "I'll eat," said Alice, "and if it makes me larger, I can
      reach the key, and if it makes me smaller, I can creep under the door, so either way I'll get
      into the garden, and I don't care which happens!" </p>
    <p> She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself "which way? which way?" and laid her
      hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and was quite surprised to find
      that she remained the same size: to be sure this is what generally happens when one eats cake,
      but Alice had got into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the way things to happen, and
      it seemed quite dull and
      stupid for things to go on in the common way. </p>
    <p> So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake. </p>
 
    <p> "Curiouser and curiouser!" cried Alice, (she was so surprised that she quite forgot how to
      speak good English,) "now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Goodbye,
      feet!" (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed almost out of sight, they were
      getting so far off,) "oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and
      stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure I can't! I shall be a great deal too far off to bother
      myself about you: you must manage the best way you can—but I must be kind to them," thought
      Alice, "or perhaps they won't walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair
      of boots every Christmas." </p> 
    <image source="au-images/image_011.jpg"/> 
    <p> And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it "they must go by the carrier," she thought,
      "and how funny it'll seem, sending presents to one's own feet! And how odd the directions will
      look!  
      <lb/><b>ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.</b>
      <lb/><b>THE CARPET,</b>  
      <lb/><b>with ALICE'S LOVE</b>
    </p> 
    <p> oh dear! what nonsense I am talking!" </p>
    <p> Just at this moment, her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact, she was now
      rather more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key, and hurried
      off to the garden door. </p>
    <p> Poor Alice! it was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the
      garden with one eye, but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and cried
      again. </p>
    <p> "You ought to be ashamed of yourself," said Alice, "a great girl like you," (she might well
      say this,) "to cry in this way! Stop this instant, I tell you!" But she cried on all the same,
      shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool, about four inches deep, all round
      her, and reaching half way across the hall. After a time, she heard a little pattering of feet
      in the distance, and dried
      her eyes to see what was coming. It was the white rabbit coming back again, splendidly
      dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand, and a nosegay in the other. Alice was
      ready to ask help of any one, she felt so desperate, and as <char>the rabbit</char> passed her, she said,
      in a low, timid voice, "If you please, Sir—" <char>the rabbit</char> started violently, looked up once into
      the roof of the hall, from which the voice seemed to come, and then dropped the nosegay and
      the white kid gloves, and skurried away into the darkness, as hard as it could go. </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_013.jpg"/>
    <p> Alice took up the nosegay and gloves, and found the nosegay so delicious that she kept
      smelling at it all the time she went on talking to herself—"dear, dear! how queer everything
      is today! and yesterday everything happened just as usual: I wonder if I was changed in the
      night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I think I remember feeling rather different. But
      if I'm not the same, who in the world am I? Ah, that's the great puzzle!" And she began
      thinking over all the children she knew of the same age as herself, to see if she could have
      been changed for any of them. </p>
    <p> "I'm sure I'm not Gertrude," she said, "for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine
      doesn't go in ringlets at all—and I'm sure I ca'n't be Florence, for I know all sorts of
      things, and she, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, she's she, and I'm I, and—oh dear!
      how puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see: four
      times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is fourteen—oh
      dear! I shall never get to twenty at this rate! But the Multiplication Table don't
      signify—let's try Geography. London is the capital of France, and Rome is the capital of
      Yorkshire, and Paris—oh dear! dear! <uline>that's</uline> all wrong, I'm certain! I
      must have been changed for Florence! I'll try and say "How doth the little,"" and she crossed
      her hands on her lap, and
      began, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not sound the same as they
      used to do: </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza"> 
        <l indent="i0">"How doth the little crocodile</l>
        <l indent="i2">Improve its shining tail,</l>
        <l indent="i0">And pour the waters of the Nile</l>
        <l indent="i2">On every golden scale!</l>
      </div>  
      <div class="stanza">
        <l indent="i0">"How cheerfully it seems to grin!</l>
        <l indent="i2">How neatly spreads its claws!</l>
        <l indent="i0">And welcomes little fishes in</l>
        <l indent="i2">With gently-smiling jaws!"</l>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p> "I'm sure those are not the right words," said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears as
      she thought "I must be Florence after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little
      house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No! I've
      made up my mind about it: if I'm Florence, I'll stay down here! It'll be no use their putting
      their heads down and saying 'come up, dear!' I shall only look up and say 'who am I then? answer me that
      first, and then, if I like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down here till
      I'm somebody else—but, oh dear!" cried Alice with a sudden burst of tears, "I do wish they
        <uline>would</uline> put their heads down! I am so tired of being all alone here!" </p>
    <p> As she said this, she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to find she had put on one
      of <char>the rabbit</char>'s little gloves while she was talking. "How <uline>can</uline> I have
      done that?" thought she, "I must be growing small again." She got up and went to the table to
      measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two
      feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: soon she found out that the reason of it was
      the nosegay she held in her hand: she dropped it hastily, just in time to save herself from
      shrinking away altogether, and found that she was now only three inches high. </p>
    <p> "Now for the garden!" cried Alice, as she hurried back to the little door, but the little door was locked
      again, and the little gold key was lying on the glass table as before, and "things are worse
      than ever!" thought the poor little girl, "for I never was as small as this before, never! And
      I declare it's too bad, it is!" </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_017.jpg"/>
    <p> At this moment her foot slipped, and splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first
      idea was that she had fallen into the sea: then she remembered that she was under ground, and
      she soon made out that it was the pool of tears she had wept when she was nine feet high. "I
      wish I hadn't cried so much!" said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out, "I
      shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! Well! that'll be a queer thing, to be sure!
      However, every thing is queer today." Very soon she saw something splashing about in the pool
      near her: at first she thought it must be a walrus or a hippopotamus, but then she remembered
      how small she was herself, and soon made out that it was only a mouse, that had slipped in
      like herself. </p>
    <p> "Would it be any use, now," thought Alice, "to speak to this mouse? <char>the rabbit</char> is something
      quite out-of-the-way, no doubt, and so have I been, ever since I came down here, but that is
      no reason why <char>the mouse</char> should not be able to talk. I think I may as well try." </p>
    <p> So she began: "oh Mouse, do you know how to get out of this pool? I am very tired of
      swimming about here, oh Mouse!" <char>the mouse</char> looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to
      her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing. </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_019.jpg"/>
    <p> "Perhaps it doesn't understand English," thought Alice; "I daresay it's a French mouse, come
      over with William the Conqueror!" (for,with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long
      ago anything had happened,) so she began again: "où est ma chatte?" which was the first
      sentence out of her French lesson-book. <char>the mouse</char> gave a sudden jump in the pool, and seemed
      to quiver with fright: "oh, I beg your pardon!" cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt
      the poor animal's feelings, "I quite forgot you didn't like cats!" </p>
    <p> "Not like cats!" cried <char>the mouse</char>, in a shrill, passionate voice, "would <uline>you</uline> like cats if you were me?" </p>
    <p> "Well, perhaps not," said Alice in a soothing tone, "don't be angry about it. And yet I wish
      I could show you our cat <char>Dinah</char>: I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.
      She is such a dear quiet thing," said Alice, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the
      pool, "she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face: and she
      is such a nice soft thing to nurse, and she's such a capital one for catching mice—oh! I beg
      your pardon!" cried poor Alice again, for this time <char>the mouse</char> was bristling all over, and she felt certain
      that it was really offended, "have I offended you?" </p>
    <p> "Offended indeed!" cried <char>the mouse</char>, who seemed to be positively trembling with rage, "our
      family always <uline>hated</uline> cats! Nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't talk to me
      about them any more!" </p>
    <p> "I won't indeed!" said Alice, in a great hurry to change the conversation, "are you—are
      you—fond of—dogs?" <char>the mouse</char> did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: "there is such a nice
      little dog near our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you know,
      with oh! such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and it'll sit
      up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things—I ca'n't remember half of them—and it
      belongs to a farmer, and he says it kills all the rats and—oh dear!" said Alice sadly, "I'm
      afraid I've offended it again!" for <char>the mouse</char> was swimming away from her as hard as it could
      go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.
    </p>
    <p> So she called softly after it: "mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won't talk about cats
      and dogs any more, if you don't like them!" When <char>the mouse</char> heard this, it turned and swam
      slowly back to her: its face was quite pale, (with passion, Alice thought,) and it said in a
      trembling low voice "let's get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll
      understand why it is I hate cats and dogs." </p>
    <p> It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite full of birds and animals that had
      fallen into it. There was a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious
      creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore. </p>

    <heading> Chapter II </heading>
    <p> They were indeed a curious looking party that assembled on the bank—the birds with draggled
      feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them—all dripping wet, cross, and
      uncomfortable. The first question of course was, how to get dry: they had a consultation about
      this, and <char>Alice</char> hardly felt at all surprised at finding herself talking familiarly with the
      birds, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the
      <char>Lory</char>, who at last turned sulky, and would only say "I am older than you, and must know best,"
      and this <char>Alice</char> would not admit without knowing how old the <char>Lory</char> was, and as the <char>Lory</char>
      positively refused to tell its age, there was nothing more to be said.
    </p>
    <p> At last <char>the mouse</char>, who seemed to have some authority among them, called out "sit down, all
      of you, and attend to me! I'll soon make you dry enough!" They all sat down at once,
      shivering, in a large ring, <char>Alice</char> in the middle, with her eyes anxiously fixed on <char>the mouse</char>,
      for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon. </p>
    <p> "Ahem!" said <char>the mouse</char>, with a self-important air, "are you all ready? This is the driest
      thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! </p>
    <p> "<char>William the Conqueror</char>, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the
      English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest.
      <char>Edwin and Morcar</char>, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria—" </p>
    <p> "Ugh!" said the <char>Lory</char> with a shiver. </p>
    <p> "I beg your pardon?" said <char>the mouse</char>, frowning, but very politely, "did you speak?" </p>
    <p> "Not I!" said the <char>Lory</char> hastily. </p>
    <p> "I thought you did," said <char>the mouse</char>, "I proceed. <char>Edwin and Morcar</char>, the earls of Mercia and
      Northumbria, declared for him; and even <char>Stigand</char>, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it
      advisable to go with <char>Edgar Atheling</char> to meet <char>William</char> and offer him the crown. <char>William's</char> conduct
      was at first moderate—how are you getting on now, dear?" said <char>the mouse</char>, turning to <char>Alice</char> as
      it spoke. </p>
    <p> "As wet as ever," said poor <char>Alice</char>, "it doesn't seem to dry me at all." </p>
    <p> "In that case," said the <char>Dodo</char> solemnly, rising to his feet, "I move that the meeting
      adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies—" </p>
    <p> "Speak English!" said <char>the Duck</char>, "I don't know the meaning of half those long words, and
      what's more, I don't believe you do either!" And <char>the Duck</char> quacked a comfortable laugh to
      itself. Some of the other birds tittered audibly. </p>
    <p> "I only meant to say," said <char>the dodo</char> in a rather offended tone, "that I know of a house near
      here, where we could get the young lady and the rest of the party dried, and then we could
      listen comfortably to the story which I think you were good enough to promise to tell us,"
      bowing gravely to <char>the mouse</char>.
    </p>
    <p> <char>the mouse</char> made no objection to this, and the whole party moved along the river bank, (for
      the pool had by this time began to flow out of the hall, and the edge of it was fringed with
      rushes and forget-me-nots,) in a slow procession, <char>the dodo</char> leading the way. After a time <char>the
      Dodo</char> became impatient, and, leaving <char>the Duck</char> to bring up the rest of the party, moved on at a
      quicker pace with <char>Alice</char>, the <char>Lory</char>, and the <char>Eaglet</char>, and soon brought them to a little cottage,
      and there they sat snugly by the fire, wrapped up in blankets, until the rest of the party had
      arrived, and they were all dry again. </p>
    <p> Then they all sat down again in a large ring on the bank, and begged <char>the mouse</char> to begin his
      story. </p>
    <p> "Mine is a long and a sad tale!" said <char>the mouse</char>, turning to <char>Alice</char>, and sighing. </p>
    <p> "It <uline>is</uline> a long tail, certainly," said <char>Alice</char>, looking down with wonder
      at <char>the mouse</char>'s tail, which was coiled nearly all round the party, "but why do you call it
      sad?" and she went on puzzling about this as <char>the mouse</char> went on speaking, so that her idea of
      the tale was something like this:

    <p> "You are not attending!" said <char>the mouse</char> to <char>Alice</char> severely, "what are you thinking of?" </p>
    <p> "I beg your pardon," said <char>Alice</char> very humbly, "you had got to the fifth bend, I think?" </p>
    <p> "I had not!" cried <char>the mouse</char>, sharply and very angrily. </p>
    <p> "A knot!" said <char>Alice</char>, always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about her,
      "oh, do let me help to undo it!" </p>
    <p> "I shall do nothing of the sort!" said <char>the mouse</char>, getting up and walking away from the
      party, "you insult me by talking such nonsense!" </p>
    <p> "I didn't mean it!" pleaded poor <char>Alice</char>, "but you're so easily offended, you know." </p>
    <p> <char>the mouse</char> only growled in reply. </p>
    <p> "Please come back and finish your story!" <char>Alice</char> called after it, and the others all joined
      in chorus "yes, please do!" but <char>the mouse</char> only shook its ears, and walked quickly away, and
      was soon out of sight. </p>
    <p> "What a pity it wouldn't stay!" sighed <char>the lory</char>, and an old Crab took the opportunity of
      saying to its daughter "Ah, my dear! let this be a lesson to you never to lose <uline>your</uline>
      temper!" "Hold your tongue, Ma!" said the young Crab, a little snappishly, "you're enough to
      try the patience of an oyster!" </p>
    <p> "I wish I had our <char>Dinah</char> here, I know I do!" said <char>Alice</char> aloud, addressing no one in
      particular, "she'd soon fetch it back!" </p>
    <p> "And who is <char>Dinah</char>, if I might venture to ask the question?" said <char>the lory</char>. </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_031.jpg"/>
    <p> <char>Alice</char> replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet, "<char>Dinah</char>'s our cat. And
      she's such a capital one for catching mice, you can't think! And oh! I wish you could see her
      after the birds! Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!" </p>
    <p> This answer caused a remarkable sensation among the party: some of the birds hurried off at
      once; one old magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking "I really must be
      getting home: the night air does not suit my throat," and a canary called out in a trembling
      voice to its children "come away from her, my dears, she's no fit company for you!" On various
      pretexts, they all moved off, and <char>Alice</char> was soon left alone. </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_033.jpg"/>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p> She sat for some while sorrowful and silent, but she was not long before she recovered her
      spirits, and began talking to herself again as usual: "I do wish some of them had stayed a
      little longer! and I was getting to be such friends with them—really <char>the lory</char> and I were
      almost like sisters! and so was that dear little Eaglet! And then <char>the duck</char> and <char>the dodo</char>! How
      nicely <char>the duck</char> sang to us as we came along through the water: and if the Dodo hadn't known
      the way to that nice little cottage, I don't know when we should have got dry again—" and
      there is no knowing how long she might have prattled on in this way, if she had not suddenly
      caught the sound of pattering feet. </p>
    <p> It was the white rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about it as it
      went, as if it had lost something, and she heard it muttering to itself "the Marchioness! the
      Marchioness! oh my dear paws! oh my fur and whiskers! She'll have me executed, as sure as
        ferrets are ferrets!
      Where <uline>can</uline> I have dropped them, I wonder?" <char>Alice</char> guessed in a moment
      that it was looking for the nosegay and the pair of white kid gloves, and she began hunting
      for them, but they were now nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since her
      swim in the pool, and her walk along the river-bank with its fringe of rushes and
      forget-me-nots, and the glass table and the little door had vanished. </p>
    <p> Soon <char>the rabbit</char> noticed <char>Alice</char>, as she stood looking curiously about her, and at once said in
      a quick angry tone, "why, Mary Ann! what <uline>are</uline> you doing out here? Go
      home this moment, and look on my dressing-table for my gloves and nosegay, and fetch them
      here, as quick as you can run, do you hear?" and <char>Alice</char> was so much frightened that she ran off
      at once, without saying a
      word, in the direction which <char>the rabbit</char> had pointed out. </p>
    <p> She soon found herself in front of a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright
      brass plate with the name <b>W. RABBIT, ESQ.</b> She went in, and hurried upstairs, for fear
      she should meet the real Mary Ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the
      gloves: she knew that one pair had been lost in the hall, "but of course," thought <char>Alice</char>, "it
      has plenty more of them in its house. How queer it seems to be going messages for a rabbit! I
      suppose <char>Dinah</char>'ll be sending me messages next!" And she began fancying the sort of things that
      would happen: "Miss <char>Alice</char>! come here directly and get ready for your walk!" "Coming in a
      minute, nurse! but I've got to watch this mousehole till <char>Dinah</char> comes back, and see that the
      mouse doesn't get out—" "only I don't think," <char>Alice</char> went on, "that they'd let <char>Dinah</char> stop in
      the house, if it began ordering people about like that!"
    </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_035.jpg"/>
    <p> By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room, with a table in the window on
      which was a looking-glass and, (as <char>Alice</char> had hoped,) two or three pairs of tiny white kid
      gloves: she took up a pair of gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell
      upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass: there was no label on it this time
      with the words "drink me," but nonetheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips: "I know
      something interesting is sure to happen," she said to herself, "whenever I eat or drink
      anything, so I'll see what this bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow larger, for I'm
      quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!" </p>
    <p> It did so indeed, and much sooner than she expected: before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her
      head pressing against the ceiling, and she stooped to save her neck from being broken, and
      hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself "that's quite enough—I hope I sha'n't grow any
      more—I wish I hadn't drunk so much!" </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_036.jpg"/>
    <p> Alas! it was too late: she went on growing and growing, and very soon had to kneel down: in
      another minute there was not room even for this, and she tried the effect of lying down, with
      one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head. Still she went on
      growing, and as a last resource she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the
      chimney, and said to herself "now I can do no more—what <uline>will</uline> become of
      me?" </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p> Luckily for <char>Alice</char>, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no
      larger; still it was very uncomfortable, and as there seemed to be no sort of chance of ever
      getting out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy. "It was much pleasanter at home,"
      thought poor <char>Alice</char>, "when one wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered
      about by mice and rabbits—I almost wish I hadn't gone down that rabbit-hole, and yet, and
      yet—it's rather curious, you know, this sort of life. I do wonder what <uline>can</uline> have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that sort of
      thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There out to be a book written
      about me, that there ought! and when I grow up I'll write one—but I'm grown up now" said she
      in a sorrowful tone, "at least there's no room to grow up any more <uline>here</uline>." </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_037.jpg"/>
    <p> "But then," thought <char>Alice</char>, "shall I <uline>never</uline> get any older than I am now? That'll be a
      comfort, one way—never to be an old woman—but then—always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I
      shouldn't like <uline>that</uline>!" </p>
    <p> "Oh, you foolish <char>Alice</char>!" she said again, "how can you learn lessons in here? Why, there's
      hardly room for you, and no room at all for any lesson-books!" </p>
    <p> And so she went on, taking first one side, and then the other, and making quite a
      conversation of it altogether, but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside, which made
      her stop to listen. </p>
    <p> "Mary Ann! Mary Ann!" said the voice, "fetch me my gloves this moment!" Then came a little
      pattering of feet on the stairs: <char>Alice</char> knew it was <char>the rabbit</char> coming to look for her, and she
      trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as
      large as <char>the rabbit</char>, and had no reason to be afraid of it. Presently <char>the rabbit</char> came to the
      door, and tried to open it, but as it opened inwards, and <char>Alice</char>'s elbow was against it, the
      attempt proved a failure. <char>Alice</char> heard it say to itself "then I'll go round and get in at the window." </p>
    <p> "<uline>That</uline> you wo'n't!" thought <char>Alice</char>, and, after waiting till she fancied
      she heard <char>the rabbit</char>, just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a
      snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall
      and a crash of breaking glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had
      fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort. </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_040.jpg"/>
    <p> Next came an angry voice—<char>the rabbit</char>'s—"Pat, Pat! where are you?" And then a voice she had
      never heard before, "shure then I'm here! digging for apples, anyway, yer honour!" </p>
    <p> "Digging for apples indeed!" said <char>the rabbit</char> angrily, "here, come and help me out of <uline>this</uline>!"—Sound of more breaking glass. </p>
    <p> "Now, tell me, Pat, what is that coming out of the window?" </p>
    <p> "Shure it's an arm, yer honour!" (He pronounced it "arrum".) </p>
    <p> "An arm, you goose! Who ever saw an arm that size? Why, it fills the whole window, don't you
      see?" </p>
    <p> "Shure, it does, yer honour, but it's an arm for all that." </p>
    <p> "Well, it's no business there: go and take it away!" </p>
    <p> There was a long silence after this, and <char>Alice</char> could only hear whispers now and then, such
      as "shure I don't like it, yer honour, at all at all!" "do as I tell you, you coward!" and at
      last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air. This time there were
        <uline>two</uline> little shrieks, and more breaking glass—"what a number of
      cucumber-frames there must be!" thought <char>Alice</char>, "I wonder what they'll do next! As for pulling
      me out of the window, I only wish they <uline>could</uline>! I'm sure <uline>I</uline> don't want to stop in here any longer!" </p>
    <p> She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of little cart-wheels, and
      the sound of a good many voices all talking together: she made out the words "where's the
      other ladder?—why, I hadn't to bring but one, Bill's got the other—here, put 'em up at this
      corner—no, tie 'em together first—they don't reach high enough yet—oh, they'll do well enough,
      don't be particular—here, Bill! catch hold of this rope—will the roof bear?—mind that loose
      slate—oh, it's coming down! heads below!—" (a loud crash) "now, who did that?—it was Bill, I
      fancy—who's to go down the chimney?—nay, <uline>I</uline> sha'n't! <uline>you</uline> do it!—<uline>that</uline> I won't then—Bill's got to go down—here,
      Bill! the master says you've to go down the chimney!" </p>
    <p> "Oh, so Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?" said <char>Alice</char> to herself, "why, they seem
      to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn't be in Bill's place for a good deal: the fireplace is a
      pretty tight one, but I <uline>think</uline> I can kick a little!" </p>
    <p> She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till she heard a little animal (she
      couldn't guess what sort it was) scratching and scrambling in the chimney close above her:
      then, saying to herself "this is Bill," she gave one sharp kick, and waited again to see what
      would happen next. </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_043.jpg"/>
    <p> The first thing was a general chorus of "there goes Bill!" then <char>the rabbit</char>'s voice alone
      "catch him, you by the hedge!" then silence, and then another confusion of voices, "how was
      it, old fellow? what happened to you? tell us all about it." </p>
    <p> Last came a little feeble squeaking voice, ("that's Bill" thought <char>Alice</char>,) which said "well,
      I hardly know—I'm all of a fluster myself—something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and
      the next minute up I goes like a rocket!" "And so you did, old fellow!" said the other
        voices.
    </p>
    <p> "We must burn the house down!" said the voice of <char>the rabbit</char>, and <char>Alice</char> called out as loud as
      she could "if you do, I'll set <char>Dinah</char> at you!" This caused silence again, and while <char>Alice</char> was
      thinking "but how can I get <char>Dinah</char> here?" she found to her great delight that she was getting
      smaller: very soon she was able to get up out of the uncomfortable position in which she had
      been lying, and in two or three minutes more she was once more three inches high. </p>
    <p> She ran out of the house as quick as she could, and found quite a crowd of little animals
      waiting outside—guinea-pigs, white mice, squirrels, and "Bill" a little green lizard, that was
      being supported in the arms of one of the guinea-pigs, while another was giving it something
      out of a bottle. They all made a rush at her the moment she appeared, but <char>Alice</char> ran her
      hardest, and soon found herself in a thick wood. </p>

    <p>
      
    </p>
  </chapter>
  <chapter>
    <heading> Chapter III </heading>
    <p> "The first thing I've got to do," said <char>Alice</char> to herself, as she wandered about in the wood,
      "is to grow to my right size, and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.
      I think that will be the best plan." </p>
    <p> It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged: the only
      difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it, and while she was
      peering anxiously among the trees round her, a little sharp bark just over her head made her
      look up in a great hurry. </p>
    <p> An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out
      one paw, trying to reach her: "poor thing!" said Alice in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it, but
      she was terribly alarmed all the while at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case
      it would probably devour her in spite of all her coaxing. Hardly knowing what she did, she
      picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy: whereupon the puppy jumped into
      the air off all its feet at once, and with a yelp of delight rushed at the stick, and made
      believe to worry it then Alice dodged behind a great thistle to keep herself from being run
      over, and, the moment she appeared at the other side, the puppy made another dart at the
      stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold: then Alice, thinking it was very
      like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under
      its feet, ran round the thistle again: then the puppy begin a series of short charges at the
      stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely
      all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out
      of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.
    </p>
    <p> This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape. She set off at once, and ran
      till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance, and till she was quite tired and
      out of breath. </p>
    <p> "And yet what a dear little puppy it was!" said Alice, as she leant against a buttercup to
      rest herself, and fanned herself with her hat. "I should have liked teaching it tricks, if—if
      I'd only been the right size to do it! Oh! I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up
      again! Let me see; how <i>is</i> it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or drink something
      or other, but the great question is what?" </p> 
    <p> The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the
      blades of grass but could not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat under the
      circumstances. There was a large mushroom near her, about the same height as herself, and when
      she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her to look
      and see what was on the top of it. </p>
    <p> She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met
      those of a large blue caterpillar, which was sitting with its arms folded, quietly smoking a
      long hookah, and taking not the least notice of her or of anything else. </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_049.jpg"/>
    <p> For some time they looked at each other in silence: at last the caterpillar took the hookah
      out of its mouth, and languidly addressed her. </p>
    <p> "Who are you?" said the caterpillar. </p>
    <p> This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation: Alice replied rather shyly, "I—I
      hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I
      think I must have been changed several times since that." </p>
    <p> "What do you mean by that?" said the caterpillar, "explain yourself!" </p>
    <p> "I ca'n't explain <uline>myself</uline>, I'm afraid, sir," said Alice, "because I'm not myself, you see." </p>
    <p> "I don't see," said the caterpillar. </p>
    <p> "I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly," Alice replied very politely, "for I ca'n't
      understand it myself, and really to be so many different sizes in one day is very confusing." </p>
    <p> "It isn't," said the caterpillar. </p>
    <p> "Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet," said Alice, "but when you have to turn into a
      chrysalis, you know, and then after that into a butterfly, I should think it'll feel a little
      queer, don't you think so?" </p>
    <p> "Not a bit," said the caterpillar. </p>
    <p> "All I know is," said Alice, "it would feel queer to <uline>me</uline>." </p>
    <p> "<uline>You</uline>!" said the caterpillar contemptuously, "who are you?" </p>
    <p> Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation: Alice felt a little
      irritated at the caterpillar making such very short remarks, and she drew herself up and said
      very gravely "I think you ought to tell me who <uline>you</uline> are, first." </p>
    <p> "Why?" said the caterpillar. </p>
    <p> Here was another puzzling question: and as Alice had no reason ready, and the caterpillar seemed to be in a
      very bad temper, she turned round and walked away. </p>
    <p> "Come back!" the caterpillar called after her, "I've something important to say!" </p>
    <p> This sounded promising: Alice turned and came back again. </p>
    <p> "Keep your temper," said the caterpillar. </p>
    <p> "Is that all?" said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could. </p>
    <p> "No," said the caterpillar. </p>
    <p> Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after all
      the caterpillar might tell her something worth hearing. For some minutes it puffed away at its
      hookah without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth
      again, and said "so you think you're changed, do you?" </p>
    <p> "Yes, sir," said Alice, "I ca'n't remember the things I used to know—I've tried to say "How
      doth the little busy bee" and it came all different!" </p>
    <p> "Try and repeat "You are old, father William"," said the caterpillar. </p>
    <p> Alice folded her hands, and began: </p>

    <p> "That is not said right," said the caterpillar. </p>
    <p> "Not quite right, I'm afraid," said Alice timidly, "some of the words have got altered." </p>
    <p> "It is wrong from beginning to end," said the caterpillar decidedly, and there was silence
      for some minutes: the caterpillar was the first to speak. </p>
    <p> "What size do you want to be?" it asked. </p>
    <p> "Oh, I'm not particular as to size," Alice hastily replied, "only one doesn't like changing
      so often, you know." </p>
    <p> "Are you content now?" said the caterpillar. </p>
    <p> "Well, I should like to be a <uline>little</uline> larger, sir, if you wouldn't
      mind," said Alice, "three inches is such a wretched height to be." </p>
    <p> "It is a very good height indeed!" said the caterpillar loudly and angrily, rearing itself
      straight up as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high). </p>
    <p> "But I'm not used to it!" pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone, and she thought to herself
      "I wish the creatures wouldn't be so easily offended!" </p>
    <p> "You'll get used to it in time," said the caterpillar, and it put the hookah into its mouth,
      and began smoking again.
    </p> 
    <p> This time Alice waited quietly until it chose to speak again: in a few minutes the
      caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and got down off the mushroom, and crawled away
      into the grass, merely remarking as it went; "the top will make you grow taller, and the stalk
      will make you grow shorter." </p>
    <p> "The top of <uline>what</uline>? the stalk of <uline>what</uline>?" thought
      Alice. </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_061.jpg"/>
    <p> "Of the mushroom," said the caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud, and in another
      moment was out of sight. </p>
    <p> Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, and then picked it and
      carefully broke it in two, taking the stalk in one hand, and the top in the other. </p>
    <p> "<uline>Which</uline> does the stalk do?" she said, and nibbled a little bit of it
      to try; the next moment she felt a violent blow on her chin: it had struck her foot!
    </p>
    <p> She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but as she did not shrink any
      further, and had not dropped the top of the mushroom, she did not give up hope yet. There was
      hardly room to open her mouth, with her chin pressing against her foot, but she did it at
      last, and managed to bite off a little bit of the top of the mushroom. </p>

    <p> "Come! my head's free at last!" said Alice in a tone of delight, which changed into alarm in
      another moment, when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be seen: she looked down
      upon an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves
      that lay far below her. </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_062.jpg"/>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p> "What <uline>can</uline> all that green stuff be?" said Alice, "and where <uline>have</uline> my shoulders got to? And oh! my poor hands! how is it I ca'n't see
      you?" She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little
      rustling among the leaves. Then she tried to bring her head down to her hands, and was
      delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in every direction, like a serpent.
      She had just succeeded in bending it down in a beautiful zig-zag, and was going to dive in
      among the leaves, which she found to be the tops of the trees of the wood she had been
      wandering in, when a sharp hiss made her draw back: a large pigeon had flown into her face,
      and was violently beating her with its wings. </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_063.jpg"/>
    <p> "Serpent!" screamed the pigeon. </p>
    <p> "I'm <uline>not</uline> a serpent!" said Alice indignantly, "let me alone!"
    </p>
    <p> "I've tried every way!" the pigeon said desperately, with a kind of sob: "nothing seems to
      suit 'em!" </p>
    <p> "I haven't the least idea what you mean," said Alice. </p>
    <p> "I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried hedges," the pigeon
      went on without attending to her, "but them serpents! There's no pleasing 'em!" </p>
    <p> Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything till
      the pigeon had finished. </p>
    <p> "As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs!" said the pigeon, "without being on the
      look out for serpents, day and night! Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!" </p>
    <p> "I'm very sorry you've been annoyed," said Alice, beginning to see its meaning. </p>
    <p> "And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood," said the pigeon raising its voice to a
      shriek, "and was just thinking I was free of 'em at last, they must needs come down from the
      sky! Ugh! Serpent!" </p>
    <p> "But I'm <uline>not</uline> a serpent," said Alice, "I'm a—I'm a—" </p>
    <p> "Well! <uline>What</uline> are you?" said the pigeon, "I see you're trying to invent
        something."
    </p>
    <p> "I—I'm a little girl," said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of
      changes she had gone through. </p>
    <p> "A likely story indeed!" said the pigeon, "I've seen a good many of them in my time, but
      never <uline>one</uline> with such a neck as yours! No, you're a serpent, I know <uline>that</uline> well enough! I suppose you'll tell me next that you never tasted an
      egg!" </p>
    <p> "I <uline>have</uline> tasted eggs, certainly," said Alice, who was a very truthful
      child, "but indeed I do'n't want any of yours. I do'n't like them raw." </p>
    <p> "Well, be off, then!" said the pigeon, and settled down into its nest again. Alice crouched
      down among the trees, as well as she could, as her neck kept getting entangled among the
      branches, and several times she had to stop and untwist it. Soon she remembered the pieces of
      mushroom which she still held in her hands, and set to work very carefully, nibbling first at
      one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had
      succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual size. </p>
    <p> It was so long since she had been of the right size that it felt quite strange at first, but she got quite
      used to it in a minute or two, and began talking to herself as usual: "well! there's half my
      plan done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from
      one minute to another! However, I've got to my right size again: the next thing is, to get
      into that beautiful garden—how <uline>is</uline> that to be done, I wonder?" </p>
    <p> Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a doorway leading right into
      it. "That's very curious!" she thought, "but everything's curious today: I may as well go in."
      And in she went. </p>
    <p> Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little glass table: "now,
      I'll manage better this time" she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key,
      and unlocking the door that led into the garden. Then she set to work eating the pieces of
      mushroom till she was about fifteen inches high: then she walked down the little passage: and
        <uline>then</uline>—she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the
      bright flowerbeds and the cool fountains. </p>

  <chapter>
    <heading> Chapter IV </heading>
    <p> A large rose tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses on it were white, but
      there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red. This Alice thought a very curious
      thing, and she went near to watch them, and just as she came up she heard one of them say
      "look out, Five! Don't go splashing paint over me like that!" </p>
    <p> "I couldn't help it," said Five in a sulky tone, "Seven jogged my elbow." </p>
    <p> On which Seven lifted up his head and said "that's right, Five! Always lay the blame on
      others!" </p>
    <p> "<uline>You'd</uline> better not talk!" said Five, "I heard the Queen say only yesterday she thought
      of having you beheaded!" </p>
    <p> "What for?" said the one who had spoken first. </p>
    <p> "That's not your business, Two!" said Seven. </p>
    <p> "Yes, it <uline>is</uline> his business!" said Five, "and I'll tell him: it was for
      bringing in tulip-roots to the cook instead of potatoes." </p>
    <p> Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun "well! Of all the unjust things—" when his
      eye fell upon Alice, and he stopped suddenly; the others looked round, and all of them took
      off their hats and bowed low. </p>
    <p> "Would you tell me, please," said Alice timidly, "why you are painting those roses?" </p>
    <p> Five and Seven looked at Two, but said nothing: Two began, in a low voice, "why, Miss, the
      fact is, this ought to have been a red rose tree, and we put a white one in by mistake, and if
      the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off. So, you see, we're doing
      our best, before she comes, to—" At this moment Five, who had been looking anxiously across
      the garden called out "the Queen! the Queen!" and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon
      their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the
      Queen. </p>
    <p> First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners, flat
      and oblong, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were all
      ornamented with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came the
      Royal children: there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along, hand
      in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly kings
      and queens, among whom Alice recognised the white rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous
      manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her. Then followed
      the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's crown on a cushion, and, last of all this grand
      procession, came <b>THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS</b>. </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_071.jpg"/>
    <p> When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said severely "who
      is this?" She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply. </p>
    <p> "Idiot!" said the Queen, turning up her nose, and asked Alice "what's your name?" </p>
    <p> "My name is Alice, so please your Majesty," said Alice boldly, for she thought to herself
      "why, they're only a pack of cards! I needn't be afraid of them!" </p>
    <p> "Who are these?" said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners lying round the rose tree,
      for, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the
      rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers,
      or three of her own children. </p>
    <p> "How should <uline>I</uline> know?" said Alice, surprised at her own courage, "it's
      no business of <uline>mine</uline>." </p>
    <p> The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a minute, began in a voice
      of thunder "off with her—" </p>
    <p> "Nonsense!" said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was silent. </p>
    <p> The King laid his hand upon her arm, and said timidly "remember, my dear! She is only a
        child!"
    </p>
    <p> The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave "turn them over!" </p>
    <p> The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot. </p>
    <p> "Get up!" said the Queen, in a shrill loud voice, and the three gardeners instantly jumped
      up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen, the Royal children, and everybody else. </p>
    <p> "Leave off that!" screamed the Queen, "you make me giddy." And then, turning to the rose
      tree, she went on "what <uline>have</uline> you been doing here?" </p>
    <p> "May it please your Majesty," said Two very humbly, going down on one knee as he spoke, "we
      were trying—" </p>
    <p> "I see!" said the Queen, who had meantime been examining the roses, "off with their heads!"
      and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the three
      unfortunate gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection. </p>
    <p> "You sha'n't be beheaded!" said Alice, and she put them into her pocket: the three soldiers
      marched once round her, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the others. </p>
    <p> "Are their heads off?" shouted the Queen. </p>
    <p> "Their heads are gone," the soldiers shouted in reply, "if it please your Majesty!"
    </p>
    <p> "That's right!" shouted the Queen, "can you play croquet?" </p>
    <p> The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was evidently meant for her. </p>
    <p> "Yes!" shouted Alice at the top of her voice. </p>
    <p> "Come on then!" roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession, wondering very much what
      would happen next. </p>
    <p> "It's—it's a very fine day!" said a timid little voice: she was walking by the white rabbit,
      who was peeping anxiously into her face. </p>
    <p> "Very," said Alice, "where's the Marchioness?" </p>
    <p> "Hush, hush!" said <char>the rabbit</char> in a low voice, "she'll hear you. The Queen's the Marchioness:
      didn't you know that?" </p>
    <p> "No, I didn't," said Alice, "what of?" </p>
    <p> "Queen of Hearts," said <char>the rabbit</char> in a whisper, putting its mouth close to her ear, "and
      Marchioness of Mock Turtles." </p>
    <p> "What are <uline>they</uline>?" said Alice, but there was no time for the answer,
      for they had reached the croquet-ground, and the game began instantly. </p>
    <p> Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in all her life: it was all
      in ridges and furrows: the croquet-balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live ostriches, and
      the soldiers had to double themselves up, and stand on their feet and hands, to make the arches. </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_075.jpg"/>
    <p> The chief difficulty which Alice found at first was to manage her ostrich: she got its body
      tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally,
      just as she had got its neck straightened out nicely, and was going to give a blow with its
      head, it <uline>would</uline> twist itself round, and look up into her face, with such
      a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had got its
      head down, and was going to begin again, it was very confusing to find that the hedgehog had
      unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was generally a
      ridge or a furrow in her way, wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and as the
      doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the
      conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed. </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_076.jpg"/>
    <p> The players all played at once without waiting for turns, and quarrelled all the while at
      the tops of their voices, and in a very few minutes the Queen was in a furious passion, and
      went stamping about and shouting "off with his head!" of "off with her head!" about once in a
      minute. All those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course
      had to leave off being arches to do this, so that, by the end of half an hour or so, there
      were no arches left, and all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in
      custody, and under sentence of execution. </p>
    <p> Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice "have you seen the Mock
      Turtle?" </p>
    <p> "No," said Alice, "I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is." </p>
    <p> "Come on then," said the Queen, "and it shall tell you its history." </p>
    <p> As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to the company
      generally, "you are all pardoned." </p>
    <p> "Come, that's a good thing!" thought Alice, who had felt quite grieved at the number of executions which the Queen
      had ordered. </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_078.jpg"/>
    <p> They very soon came upon a Gryphon, which lay fast asleep in the sun: (if you don't know
      what a Gryphon is, look at the picture): "Up, lazy thing!" said the Queen, "and take this
      young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to hear its history. I must go back and see after some
      executions I ordered," and she walked off, leaving Alice with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite
      like the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it quite as safe to stay as to go
      after that savage Queen: so she waited. </p>
    <p> The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till she was out of sight:
      then it chuckled. "What fun!" said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice. </p>
    <p> "What <uline>is</uline> the fun?" said Alice. </p>
    <p> "Why, <uline>she</uline>," said the Gryphon; "it's all her fancy, that: they never
      executes nobody, you know: come on!"
    </p>
    <p> "Everybody says 'come on!' here," thought Alice as she walked slowly after the Gryphon; "I
      never was ordered about so before in all my life—never!" </p>
    <p> They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance, sitting sad and
      lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, Alice could here it sighing as if
      its heart would break. She pitied it deeply: "what is its sorrow?" she asked the Gryphon, and
      the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, "it's all its fancy, that: it
      hasn't got no sorrow, you know: come on!" </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_079.jpg"/>
    <p> So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full of tears, but
      said nothing. </p>
    <p> "This here young lady" said the Gryphon, "wants for to know your history, she do." </p>
    <p> "I'll tell it," said the Mock Turtle, in a deep hollow tone, "sit down, and don't speak till
      I've finished." </p>
    <p> So they sat down, and no one spoke for some minutes: Alice thought to herself "I don't see
      how it can <uline>ever</uline> finish, if it doesn't begin," but she waited patiently. </p>
    <p> "Once," said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, "I was a real Turtle." </p>
    <p> These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation
      of "hjckrrh!" from the Gryphon, and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was
      very nearly getting up and saying, "thank you, sir, for your interesting story," but she could
      not help thinking there <uline>must</uline> be more to come, so she sat still and said
      nothing. </p>
    <p> "When we were little," the Mock Turtle went on, more calmly, though still sobbing a little
      now and then, "we went to school in the sea. The master was an old Turtle—we used to call him
      Tortoise—" </p>
    <p> "Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?" asked Alice.
    </p>
    <p> "We called him Tortoise because he taught us," said the Mock Turtle angrily, "really you are
      very dull!" </p>
    <p> "You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question," added the Gryphon,
      and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth:
      at last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, "get on, old fellow! Don't be all day!" and the
      Mock Turtle went on in these words: </p>
    <p> "You may not have lived much under the sea—" ("I haven't," said Alice,) "and perhaps you
      were never even introduced to a lobster—" (Alice began to say "I once tasted—" but hastily
      checked herself, and said "no, never," instead,) "so you can have no idea what a delightful
      thing a Lobster Quadrille is!" </p>
    <p> "No, indeed," said Alice, "what sort of a thing is it?" </p>
    <p> "Why," said the Gryphon, "you form into a line along the sea shore—" </p>
    <p> "Two lines!" cried the Mock Turtle, "seals, turtles, salmon, and so on—advance twice—" </p>
    <p> "Each with a lobster as partner!" cried the Gryphon. </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_082.jpg"/>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p> "Of course," the Mock Turtle said, "advance twice, set to partners—" </p>
    <p> "Change lobsters, and retire in same order—" interrupted the Gryphon. </p>
    <p> "Then, you know," continued the Mock Turtle, "you throw the—" </p>
    <p> "The lobsters!" shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air. </p>
    <p> "As far out to sea as you can—" </p>
    <p> "Swim after them!" screamed the Gryphon. </p>
    <p> "Turn a somersault in the sea!" cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly about. </p>
    <p> "Change lobsters again!" yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice, "and then—" </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_084.jpg"/>
    <p> "That's all," said the Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping its voice, and the two creatures, who
      had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly and quietly,
      and looked at Alice. </p>
    <p> "It must be a very pretty dance," said Alice timidly. </p>
    <p> "Would you like to see a little of it?" said the Mock Turtle. </p>
    <p> "Very much indeed," said Alice. </p>
    <p> "Come, let's try the first figure!" said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon, "we can do it without lobsters, you
      know. Which shall sing?" </p>
    <p> "Oh! <uline>you</uline> sing!" said the Gryphon, "I've forgotten the words." </p>
    <p> So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and then treading on her
      toes when they came too close, and waving their fore-paws to mark the time, while the Mock
      Turtle sang, slowly and sadly, these words: </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <l indent="i0">"Beneath the waters of the sea</l>
        <l indent="i0">Are lobsters thick as thick can be—</l>
        <l indent="i0">They love to dance with you and me,</l>
        <l indent="i2">My own, my gentle Salmon!"</l>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p> The Gryphon joined in singing the chorus, which was: </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <l indent="i0">"Salmon come up! Salmon go down!</l>
        <l indent="i0">Salmon come twist your tail around!</l>
        <l indent="i0">Of all the fishes <uline>of</uline> the sea</l>
        <l indent="i2">There's none so good as Salmon!"</l>
        
      </div>
    </div>
    <p> "Thank you," said Alice, feeling very glad that the figure was over. </p>
    <p> "Shall we try the second figure?" said the Gryphon, "or would you prefer a song?" </p>
    <p> "Oh, a song, please!" Alice replied, so eagerly, that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended
      tone, "hm! no accounting for tastes! Sing her 'Mock Turtle Soup', will you, old fellow!" </p>
    <p> The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked with sobs, to sing
      this: </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <l indent="i0">"Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,</l>
        <l indent="i0">Waiting in a hot tureen!</l>
        <l indent="i0">Who for such dainties would not stoop?</l>
        <l indent="i0">Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!</l>
        <l indent="i0">Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!</l>
        <l indent="i4">Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!</l>
        <l indent="i4">Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!</l>
        <l indent="i0">Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,</l>
        <l indent="i4">Beautiful beautiful Soup!</l>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p> "Chorus again!" cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun to repeat it, when a cry of "the trial's
      beginning!" was heard in the distance. </p>
    <p> "Come on!" cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, he hurried off, without waiting
      for the end of the song. </p>
    <p> "What trial is it?" panted Alice as she ran, but the Gryphon only answered "come on!" and
      ran the faster, and more and more faintly came, borne on the breeze that followed them, the
      melancholy words: </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <l indent="i0">"Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,</l>
        <l indent="i0">Beautiful beautiful Soup!"</l>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p> The King and Queen were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a great crowd
      assembled around them: the Knave was in custody: and before the King stood the white rabbit,
      with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_087.jpg"/>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p> "Herald! read the accusation!" said the King. </p>
    <p> On this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment
      scroll, and read as follows: </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <l indent="i0">"The Queen of Hearts she made some tarts</l>
        <l indent="i2">All on a summer day:</l>
        <l indent="i0">The Knave of Hearts he stole those tarts,</l>
        <l indent="i2">And took them quite away!"</l>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p> "Now for the evidence," said the King, "and then the sentence." </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_088.jpg"/>
    <p> "No!" said the Queen, "first the sentence, and then the evidence!" </p>
    <p> "Nonsense!" cried Alice, so loudly that everybody jumped, "the idea of having the sentence
      first!" </p>
    <p> "Hold your tongue!" said the Queen. </p>
    <p> "I won't!" said Alice, "you're nothing but a pack of cards! Who cares for you?" </p>
    <p> At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she gave a
      little scream of fright, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with
      her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some leaves that had fluttered
      down from the trees on to her face.
    </p>
    <p> "Wake up! Alice dear!" said her sister, "what a nice long sleep you've had!" </p>
    <p> "Oh, I've had such a curious dream!" said Alice, and she told her sister all her Adventures
      Under Ground, as you have read them, and when she had finished, her sister kissed her and said
      "it <uline>was</uline> a curious dream, dear, certainly! But now run in to your tea:
      it's getting late." </p>
    <p> So Alice ran off, thinking while she ran (as well she might) what a wonderful dream it had
      been. </p>

    <p> But her sister sat there some while longer, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little
      Alice and her Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream: </p>
    <p> She saw an ancient city, and a quiet river winding near it along the plain, and up the
      stream went slowly gliding a boat with a merry party of children on board—she could hear their
      voices and laughter like music over the water—and among them was another little Alice, who sat
      listening with bright eager eyes to a tale that was being told, and she listened for the words
      of the tale, and lo! it was the dream of her own little sister. So the boat wound slowly along, beneath the
      bright summer-day, with its merry crew and its music of voices and laughter, till it passed
      round one of the many turnings of the stream, and she saw it no more. </p>
    <p> Then she thought, (in a dream within the dream, as it were,) how this same little Alice
      would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman: and how she would keep, through her riper
      years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather around her other
      little children, and make <uline>their</uline> eyes bright and eager with many a
      wonderful tale, perhaps even with these very adventures of the little Alice of long-ago: and
      how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple
      joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days. </p>
