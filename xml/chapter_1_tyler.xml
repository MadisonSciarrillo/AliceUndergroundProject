    <heading> Chapter I </heading>
    <p> <char>Alice</char> was beginning to get very tired of sitting by <char>her sister</char> on the bank, and of having
        nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book <char>her sister</char> was reading, but it had
        no pictures or conversations in it, and where is the use of a book, thought <char>Alice</char>, without
        pictures or conversations? So she was considering in her own mind, (as well as she could, for
        the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid,) whether the pleasure of making a
        daisy-chain was worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when a <char>white rabbit</char>
        with pink eyes ran close by her. </p>
    <p> There was nothing very remarkable in that, nor did <char>Alice</char> think it so very much out of the
        way to hear the <char>rabbit</char> say to itself "dear, dear! I shall be too late!" (when she thought it
        over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time
        it all seemed quite natural); but when the <char>rabbit</char> actually <uline>took a watch out of
        its waistcoat-pocket</uline>, looked at it, and then hurried on, <char>Alice</char> started to her feet,
        for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket or a watch to take
        out of it, and, full of curiosity, she hurried across the field after it, and was just in time
        to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge. In a moment down went <char>Alice</char> after it,
        never once considering how in the world she was to get out again. </p>
    <p> The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down,
        so suddenly, that <char>Alice</char> had not a moment to think about stopping herself, before she found
        herself falling down what seemed a deep well. Either the well was very deep, or she fell very
        slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her, and to wonder what
        would happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it
        was too dark to see anything: then, she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they
        were filled with cupboards and book-shelves: here and there were maps and pictures hung on
        pegs. <yap>She took a jar down off one of the shelves as she passed: it was labelled "Orange Marmalade," but to her
        great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar, for fear of killing
        somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.</yap> </p>
    <p> "Well!" thought <char>Alice</char> to herself, "after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of
        tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything
        about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!" (which was most likely true.) </p>
    <p> Down, down, down. Would the fall <uline>never</uline> come to an end? "I wonder how
        many miles I've fallen by this time?" she said aloud, "I must be getting somewhere near the
        centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—" (for you
        see <char>Alice</char> had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though
        this was not a <uline>very</uline> good opportunity of showing off her knowledge, as
        there was no one to hear her, still it was good practice to say it over,) "yes that's the
        right distance, but then what Longitude or Latitude-line shall I be in?" (Alice had no
        idea what Longitude was, or
        Latitude either, but she thought they were nice grand words to say.) </p>
    <p> <yap>Presently she began again: "I wonder if I shall fall right <uline>through</uline>
        the earth! How funny it'll be to come out among the people that walk with their heads
        downwards! But I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please,
        Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?"—and she tried to curtsey as she spoke (fancy <uline>curtseying</uline> as you're falling through the air! do you think you could manage
        it?) "and what an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to ask:
        perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere."</yap> </p>
    <p> <lDiv divType="forshadowing">Down, down, down: there was nothing else to do, so <char>Alice</char> soon began talking again. "<char>Dinah</char>
        will miss me very much tonight, I should think!" (<char>Dinah</char> was the cat.) "I hope they'll remember
        her saucer of milk at tea-time! Oh, dear <char>Dinah</char>, I wish I had you here! There are no mice in
        the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know, my
        dear. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?" <yap>And here <char>Alice</char> began to get rather sleepy, and kept on
        saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way "<lDiv divType="alliteration">do cats eat bats? do cats eat bats?" and
        sometimes, "do bats eat cats?"</lDiv> for, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter which way she put
        it.</yap></lDiv> <yap>She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in
        hand with <char>Dinah</char>, and was saying to her very earnestly, "Now, <char>Dinah</char>, my dear, tell me the
        truth. Did you ever eat a bat?" when suddenly, bump! bump! down she came upon a heap of sticks
        and shavings, and the fall was over.</yap> </p>
    <p> <char>Alice</char> was not a bit hurt, and jumped on to her feet directly: she looked up, but it was all
        dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the white rabbit was still in sight,
        hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went <char>Alice</char> like the wind, and just
        heard it say, as it turned a corner, "my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!" She turned
        the corner after it, and instantly found herself in a long, low hall, lit up by a row of lamps
        which hung from the roof. </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_006.jpg"/>
    <p> There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked, and when <char>Alice</char> had been all
        round it, and tried them all, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again: suddenly
        she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing lying
        upon it, but a tiny golden key, and <char>Alice's</char> first idea was that it might belong to one of the
        doors of the hall, but alas! either the locks were too large, or the key too small, but at any
        rate it would open none of them. However, on the second time round, she came to a low curtain,
        behind which was a door about eighteen inches high: she tried the little key in the keyhole,
        and it fitted! <char>Alice</char> opened the door, and looked down a small passage, not larger than a
        rat-hole, into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall,
        and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could
        not even get her head through the doorway, "and even if my head would go through," thought
        poor <char>Alice</char>, "it would be very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I
        think I could, if I only knew how to begin." For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had
        happened lately, that <char>Alice</char> began to think very few things indeed were really impossible. </p>
    <p> There was nothing else to do, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find
        another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting up people like telescopes: this
        time there was a little bottle on it—"which certainly was not there before" said <char>Alice</char>—and
        tied round the neck of the bottle was a paper label with the words <b>DRINK ME</b> beautifully
        printed on it in large letters. </p>
    <p> It was all very well to say "drink me," "but I'll look first," said the wise little <char>Alice</char>,
        "and see whether the bottle's marked "poison" or not," for <char>Alice</char> had read several nice little
        stories about children that got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts, and other unpleasant
        things, because they <uline>would</uline> not remember the simple rules their friends
        had given them, such as, that, if you get into the fire, it will burn you, and that, if you
        cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it generally bleeds, and she had never forgotten that, if you drink a
        bottle marked "poison," it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later. </p>
    <p> However, this bottle was <uline>not</uline> marked poison, so <char>Alice</char> tasted it, and
        finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard,
        pine-apple, roast turkey, toffy, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off. </p>
    
    <p> "What a curious feeling!" said <char>Alice</char>, "I must be shutting up like a telescope." </p>
    <p> It was so indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up as it
        occurred to her that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that
        lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see whether she was going to
        shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this, "for it might end, you know," said
        <char>Alice</char> to herself, "in my going out altogether, like a candle, and what should I be like then,
        I wonder?" and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not
        remember having ever seen one. However, nothing more happened so she decided on going into the
        garden at once, but, alas for poor <char>Alice</char>! when she got to the door, she found she had
        forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for the key, she found
        she could not possibly reach it: she could see it plainly enough through the glass, and she
        tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery, and when she
        had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried. </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_009.jpg"/>
    <p> "Come! there's no use in crying!" said <char>Alice</char> to herself rather sharply, "I advise you to
        leave off this minute!" (she generally gave herself very good advice, and sometimes scolded
        herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes, <yap>and once she remembered boxing her own
        ears for having been unkind to herself in a game of croquet she was playing with herself, for this curious child
        was very fond of pretending to be two people,) "but it's no use now," thought poor <char>Alice</char>, "to
        pretend to be two people! Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make one respectable
        person!"</yap> </p>
    <p> Soon her eyes fell on a little ebony box lying under the table: she opened it, and found in
        it a very small cake, on which was lying a card with the words <b>EAT ME</b> beautifully
        printed on it in large letters. "I'll eat," said <char>Alice</char>, "and if it makes me larger, I can
        reach the key, and if it makes me smaller, I can creep under the door, so either way I'll get
        into the garden, and I don't care which happens!" </p>
    <p> She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself "which way? which way?" and laid her
        hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and was quite surprised to find
        that she remained the same size: to be sure this is what generally happens when one eats cake,
        but Alice had got into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the way things to happen, and
        it seemed quite dull and stupid for things to go on in the common way. </p>
    <p> So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake. </p>
    
    <p> "Curiouser and curiouser!" cried <char>Alice</char>, (she was so surprised that she quite forgot how to
        speak good English,) "now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Goodbye,
        feet!" (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed almost out of sight, they were
        getting so far off,) <yap>"oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and
        stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure I can't! I shall be a great deal too far off to bother
        myself about you: you must manage the best way you can—but I must be kind to them," thought
        Alice, "or perhaps they won't walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair
        of boots every Christmas."</yap> </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_011.jpg"/>
    <p> <yap>And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it "they must go by the carrier," she thought,
        "and how funny it'll seem, sending presents to one's own feet! And how odd the directions will
        look!
        <lb/><b>ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.</b>
        <lb/><b>THE CARPET,</b>
        <lb/><b>with ALICE'S LOVE</b></yap>
    </p>
    <p> oh dear! what nonsense I am talking!" </p>
    <p> Just at this moment, her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact, she was now
        rather more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key, and hurried
        off to the garden door. </p>
    <p> Poor <char>Alice</char>! it was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the
        garden with one eye, but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and cried
        again. </p>
    <p> "You ought to be ashamed of yourself," said <char>Alice</char>, "a great girl like you," (she might well
        say this,) "to cry in this way! Stop this instant, I tell you!" But she cried on all the same,
        shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool, about four inches deep, all round
        her, and reaching half way across the hall. After a time, she heard a little pattering of feet
        in the distance, and dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the <char>white rabbit</char> coming back again, splendidly
        dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand, and a nosegay in the other. <char>Alice</char> was
        ready to ask help of any one, she felt so desperate, and as the <char>rabbit</char> passed her, she said,
        in a low, timid voice, "If you please, Sir—" the <char>rabbit</char> started violently, looked up once into
        the roof of the hall, from which the voice seemed to come, and then dropped the nosegay and
        the white kid gloves, and skurried away into the darkness, as hard as it could go. </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_013.jpg"/>
    <p> <char>Alice</char> took up the nosegay and gloves, and found the nosegay so delicious that she kept
        smelling at it all the time she went on talking to herself—"dear, dear! how queer everything
        is today! and yesterday everything happened just as usual: I wonder if I was changed in the
        night? <yap>Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I think I remember feeling rather different. But
        if I'm not the same, who in the world am I? Ah, that's the great puzzle!" And she began
        thinking over all the children she knew of the same age as herself, to see if she could have
        been changed for any of them.</yap> </p>
    <yap><p> "I'm sure I'm not <char>Gertrude</char>," she said, "for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine
        doesn't go in ringlets at all—and I'm sure I ca'n't be <char>Florence</char>, for I know all sorts of
        things, and she, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, she's she, and I'm I, and—oh dear!
        how puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see: four
        times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is fourteen—oh
        dear! I shall never get to twenty at this rate! But the Multiplication Table don't
        signify—let's try Geography. London is the capital of France, and Rome is the capital of
        Yorkshire, and Paris—oh dear! dear! <uline>that's</uline> all wrong, I'm certain! I
        must have been changed for <char>Florence</char>! I'll try and say "How doth the little,"" and she crossed
        her hands on her lap, and
        began, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not sound the same as they
        used to do: </p>
    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <l indent="i0">"How doth the little crocodile</l>
            <l indent="i2">Improve its shining tail,</l>
            <l indent="i0">And pour the waters of the Nile</l>
            <l indent="i2">On every golden scale!</l>
        </div>
        <div class="stanza">
            <l indent="i0">"How cheerfully it seems to grin!</l>
            <l indent="i2">How neatly spreads its claws!</l>
            <l indent="i0">And welcomes little fishes in</l>
            <l indent="i2">With gently-smiling jaws!"</l>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p> "I'm sure those are not the right words," said poor <char>Alice</char>, and her eyes filled with tears as
        she thought "I must be <char>Florence</char> after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little
        house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No! I've
        made up my mind about it: if I'm <char>Florence</char>, I'll stay down here! It'll be no use their putting
        their heads down and saying 'come up, dear!' I shall only look up and say 'who am I then? answer me that
        first, and then, if I like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down here till
        I'm somebody else—but, oh dear!" cried Alice with a sudden burst of tears, "I do wish they
        <uline>would</uline> put their heads down! I am so tired of being all alone here!" </p></yap>
    <p> As she said this, she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to find she had put on one
        of the <char>rabbit's</char> little gloves while she was talking. "How <uline>can</uline> I have
        done that?" thought she, "I must be growing small again." She got up and went to the table to
        measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two
        feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: soon she found out that the reason of it was
        the nosegay she held in her hand: she dropped it hastily, just in time to save herself from
        shrinking away altogether, and found that she was now only three inches high. </p>
    <p> "Now for the garden!" cried <char>Alice</char>, as she hurried back to the little door, but the little door was locked
        again, and the little gold key was lying on the glass table as before, and "things are worse
        than ever!" thought the poor little girl, "for I never was as small as this before, never! And
        I declare it's too bad, it is!" </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_017.jpg"/>
    <p> At this moment her foot slipped, and splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first
        idea was that she had fallen into the sea: then she remembered that she was under ground, and
        she soon made out that it was the pool of tears she had wept when she was nine feet high. "I
        wish I hadn't cried so much!" said <char>Alice</char>, as she swam about, trying to find her way out, "I
        shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! Well! that'll be a queer thing, to be sure!
        However, every thing is queer today." Very soon she saw something splashing about in the pool
        near her: at first she thought it must be a walrus or a hippopotamus, but then she remembered
        how small she was herself, and soon made out that it was only a <char>mouse</char>, that had slipped in
        like herself. </p>
    <p> "Would it be any use, now," thought <char>Alice</char>, "to speak to this <char>mouse</char>? The <char>rabbit</char> is something
        quite out-of-the-way, no doubt, and so have I been, ever since I came down here, but that is
        no reason why the <char>mouse</char> should not be able to talk. I think I may as well try." </p>
    <p> So she began: "oh <char>Mouse</char>, do you know how to get out of this pool? I am very tired of
        swimming about here, oh <char>Mouse</char>!" The <char>mouse</char> looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to
        her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing. </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_019.jpg"/>
    <p> "Perhaps it doesn't understand English," thought <char>Alice</char>; "I daresay it's a French mouse, come
        over with William the Conqueror!" (for,with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long
        ago anything had happened,) so she began again: "où est ma chatte?" which was the first
        sentence out of her French lesson-book. The <char>mouse</char> gave a sudden jump in the pool, and seemed
        to quiver with fright: "oh, I beg your pardon!" cried <char>Alice</char> hastily, afraid that she had hurt
        the poor animal's feelings, "I quite forgot you didn't like cats!" </p>
    <p> "Not like cats!" cried the <char>mouse</char>, in a shrill, passionate voice, "would <uline>you</uline> like cats if you were me?" </p>
    <p> "Well, perhaps not," said <char>Alice</char> in a soothing tone, "don't be angry about it. And yet I wish
        I could show you our cat <char>Dinah</char>: I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.
        She is such a dear quiet thing," said <char>Alice</char>, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the
        pool, "she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face: and she
        is such a nice soft thing to nurse, and she's such a capital one for catching mice—oh! I beg
        your pardon!" cried poor <char>Alice</char> again, for this time the mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain
        that it was really offended, "have I offended you?" </p>
    <p> "Offended indeed!" cried the <char>mouse</char>, who seemed to be positively trembling with rage, "our
        family always <uline>hated</uline> cats! Nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't talk to me
        about them any more!" </p>
    <p> "I won't indeed!" said <char>Alice</char>, in a great hurry to change the conversation, "are you—are
        you—fond of—dogs?" The <char>mouse</char> did not answer, so <char>Alice</char> went on eagerly: "there is such a nice
        little dog near our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you know,
        with oh! such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and it'll sit
        up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things—I ca'n't remember half of them—and it
        belongs to a farmer, and he says it kills all the rats and—oh dear!" said <char>Alice</char> sadly, "I'm
        afraid I've offended it again!" for the <char>mouse</char> was swimming away from her as hard as it could
        go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.
    </p>
    <p> So she called softly after it: "<char>mouse</char> dear! Do come back again, and we won't talk about cats
        and dogs any more, if you don't like them!" When the <char>mouse</char> heard this, it turned and swam
        slowly back to her: its face was quite pale, (with passion, <char>Alice</char> thought,) and it said in a
        trembling low voice "let's get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll
        understand why it is I hate cats and dogs." </p>
    <p> It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite full of birds and animals that had
