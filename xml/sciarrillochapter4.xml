    <heading> Chapter IV </heading>
    <p> A large rose tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses on it were white, but
        there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red. This<char> Alice</char> thought a very curious
        thing, and she went near to watch them, and just as she came up she heard one of them say
        "look out, Five! Don't go splashing paint over me like that!" </p>
    <p> "I couldn't help it," said <char>Five</char> in a sulky tone, "Seven jogged my elbow." </p>
    <p> On which <char>Seven</char> lifted up his head and said "that's right, Five! Always lay the blame on
        others!" </p>
    <p> "<uline>You'd</uline> better not talk!" said Five, "I heard the Queen say only yesterday she thought
        of having you beheaded!" </p>
    <p> "What for?" said the one who had spoken first. </p>
    <p> "That's not your business, Two!" said <char>Seven.</char> </p>
    <p> "Yes, it <uline>is</uline> his business!" said <char>Five</char>, "and I'll tell him: it was for
        bringing in tulip-roots to the cook instead of potatoes." </p>
    <p> <char>Seven </char>flung down his brush, and had just begun "well! Of all the unjust things—" when his
        eye fell upon <char>Alice</char>, and he stopped suddenly; the others looked round, and all of them took
        off their hats and bowed low. </p>
    <p> "Would you tell me, please," said <char>Alice</char> timidly, "why you are painting those roses?" </p>
    <p> Five and Seven looked at Two, but said nothing: Two began, in a low voice, "why, Miss, the
        fact is, this ought to have been a red rose tree, and we put a white one in by mistake, and if
        the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off. So, you see, we're doing
        our best, before she comes, to—" At this moment Five, who had been looking anxiously across
        the garden called out "the Queen! the Queen!" and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon
        their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the
        Queen. </p>
    <p> First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners, flat
        and oblong, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were all
        ornamented with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came the
        Royal children: there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along, hand
        in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly kings
        and queens, among whom <char>Alice</char> recognised the <char>white rabbit</char>: it was talking in a hurried nervous
        manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her. Then followed
        the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's crown on a cushion, and, last of all this grand
        procession, came <b>THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS</b>. </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_071.jpg"/>
    <p> When the procession came opposite to <char>Alice</char>, they all stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said severely "who
        is this?" She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply. </p>
    <p> "Idiot!" said the Queen, turning up her nose, and asked Alice "what's your name?" </p>
    <p> "My name is <char>Alice</char>, so please your Majesty," said <char>Alic</char>e boldly, for she thought to herself
        "why, they're only a pack of cards! I needn't be afraid of them!" </p>
    <p> "Who are these?" said the <char>Queen</char>, pointing to the<char> three gardeners</char> lying round the rose tree,
        for, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the
        rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers,
        or three of her own children. </p>
    <p> "How should <uline>I</uline> know?" said <char>Alice</char>, surprised at her own courage, "it's
        no business of <uline>mine</uline>." </p>
    <p> The <char>Queen </char>turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a minute, began in a voice
        of thunder "off with her—" </p>
    <p> "Nonsense!" said <char>Alice</char>, very loudly and decidedly, and <char>the Queen</char> was silent. </p>
    <p> <char>The King</char> laid his hand upon her arm, and said timidly "remember, my dear! She is only a
        child!"
    </p>
    <p> <char>The Queen</char> turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave "turn them over!" </p>
    <p> The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot. </p>
    <p> "Get up!" said <char>the Queen</char>, in a shrill loud voice, and the <char>three gardeners</char> instantly jumped
        up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen, the Royal children, and everybody else. </p>
    <p> "Leave off that!" screamed <char>the Queen</char>, "you make me giddy." And then, turning to the rose
        tree, she went on "what <uline>have</uline> you been doing here?" </p>
    <p> "May it please your Majesty," said Two very humbly, going down on one knee as he spoke, "we
        were trying—" </p>
    <p> "I see!" said <char>the Quee</char>n, who had meantime been examining the roses, "off with their heads!"
        and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the three
        unfortunate gardeners, who ran to <char>Alice</char> for protection. </p>
    <p> "You sha'n't be beheaded!" said <char>Alice</char>, and she put them into her pocket: the <char>three soldiers</char>
        marched once round her, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the others. </p>
    <p> "Are their heads off?" shouted the Queen. </p>
    <p> "Their heads are gone," <char>the soldiers </char>shouted in reply, "if it please your Majesty!"
    </p>
    <p> "That's right!" shouted <char>the Queen</char>, "can you play croquet?" </p>
    <p> <char>The soldiers</char> were silent, and looked at <char>Alice</char>, as the question was evidently meant for her. </p>
    <p> "Yes!" shouted <char>Alice</char> at the top of her voice. </p>
    <p> "Come on then!" roared <char>the Queen</char>, and<char> Alice </char>joined the procession, wondering very much what
        would happen next. </p>
    <p> "It's—it's a very fine day!" said a timid little voice: she was walking by the white rabbit,
        who was peeping anxiously into her face. </p>
    <p> "Very," said <char>Alice</char>, "where's the Marchioness?" </p>
    <p> "Hush, hush!" said <char>the rabbit</char> in a low voice, "she'll hear you. The Queen's the Marchioness:
        didn't you know that?" </p>
    <p> "No, I didn't," said <char>Alice</char>, "what of?" </p>
    <p> "Queen of Hearts," said <char>the rabbit</char> in a whisper, putting its mouth close to her ear, "and
        Marchioness of Mock Turtles." </p>
    <p> "What are <uline>they</uline>?" said<char> Alice</char>, but there was no time for the answer,
        for they had reached the croquet-ground, and the game began instantly. </p>
    <p> <char>Alice </char>thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in all her life: it was all
        in ridges and furrows: the croquet-balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live ostriches, and
        the soldiers had to double themselves up, and stand on their feet and hands, to make the arches. </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_075.jpg"/>
    <p> The chief difficulty which <char>Alice</char> found at first was to manage her ostrich: she got its body
        tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally,
        just as she had got its neck straightened out nicely, and was going to give a blow with its
        head, it <uline>would</uline> twist itself round, and look up into her face, with such
        a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had got its
        head down, and was going to begin again, it was very confusing to find that the hedgehog had
        unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was generally a
        ridge or a furrow in her way, wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and as the
        doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, <char>Alice</char> soon came to the
        conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed. </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_076.jpg"/>
    <p> The players all played at once without waiting for turns, and quarrelled all the while at
        the tops of their voices, and in a very few minutes <char>the Queen</char> was in a furious passion, and
        went stamping about and shouting "off with his head!" of "off with her head!" about once in a
        minute. All those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course
        had to leave off being arches to do this, so that, by the end of half an hour or so, there
        were no arches left, and all the players, except <char>the King</char>, <char>the Queen</char>, and <char>Alice</char>, were in
        custody, and under sentence of execution. </p>
    <p> Then <char>the Queen </char>left off, quite out of breath, and said to <char>Alice</char> "have you seen the Mock
        Turtle?" </p>
    <p> "No," said <char>Alice,</char> "I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is." </p>
    <p> "Come on then," said <char>the Queen</char>, "and it shall tell you its history." </p>
    <p> As they walked off together, <char>Alice</char> heard <char>the King</char> say in a low voice, to the company
        generally, "you are all pardoned." </p>
    <p> "Come, that's a good thing!" thought <char>Alice</char>, who had felt quite grieved at the number of executions which<char> the Queen</char>
        had ordered. </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_078.jpg"/>
    <p> They very soon came upon a Gryphon, which lay fast asleep in the sun: (if you don't know
        what a Gryphon is, look at the picture): "Up, lazy thing!" said <char>the Queen</char>, "and take this
        young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to hear its history. I must go back and see after some
        executions I ordered," and she walked off, leavin<char>g Alice</char> with the <char>Gryphon.</char> <char>Alice</char> did not quite
        like the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it quite as safe to stay as to go
        after that savage Queen: so she waited. </p>
    <p> The <char>Gryphon </char>sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched<char> the Queen</char> till she was out of sight:
        then it chuckled. "What fun!" said the <char>Gryphon</char>, half to itself, half to <char>Alice.</char> </p>
    <p> "What <uline>is</uline> the fun?" said <char>Alice</char>. </p>
    <p> "Why, <uline>she</uline>," said the<char> Gryphon</char>; "it's all her fancy, that: they never
        executes nobody, you know: come on!"
    </p>
    <p> "Everybody says 'come on!' here," thought <char>Alice </char>as she walked slowly after the <char>Gryphon</char>; "I
        never was ordered about so before in all my life—never!" </p>
    <p> They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance, sitting sad and
        lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, <char>Alice</char> could here it sighing as if
        its heart would break. She pitied it deeply: "what is its sorrow?" she asked the Gryphon, and
        the <char>Gryphon </char>answered, very nearly in the same words as before, "it's all its fancy, that: it
        hasn't got no sorrow, you know: come on!" </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_079.jpg"/>
    <p> So they went up to the<char> Mock Turtle</char>, who looked at them with large eyes full of tears, but
        said nothing. </p>
    <p> "This here young lady" said the <char>Gryphon</char>, "wants for to know your history, she do." </p>
    <p> "I'll tell it," said the <char>Mock Turtle</char>, in a deep hollow tone, "sit down, and don't speak till
        I've finished." </p>
    <p> So they sat down, and no one spoke for some minutes: <char>Alice</char> thought to herself "I don't see
        how it can <uline>ever</uline> finish, if it doesn't begin," but she waited patiently. </p>
    <p> "Once," said the <char>Mock Turtle</char> at last, with a deep sigh, "I was a real Turtle." </p>
    <p> These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation
        of "hjckrrh!" from the <char>Gryphon</char>, and the constant heavy sobbing of the <char>Mock Turtle</char>. <char>Alice</char> was
        very nearly getting up and saying, "thank you, sir, for your interesting story," but she could
        not help thinking there <uline>must</uline> be more to come, so she sat still and said
        nothing. </p>
    <p> "When we were little," the <char>Mock Turtle</char> went on, more calmly, though still sobbing a little
        now and then, "we went to school in the sea. The master was an old Turtle—we used to call him
        Tortoise—" </p>
    <p> "Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?" asked<char> Alice.</char>
    </p>
    <p> "We called him Tortoise because he taught us," said the <char>Mock Turtle</char> angrily, "really you are
        very dull!" </p>
    <p> "You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question," added the <char>Gryphon</char>,
        and then they both sat silent and looked at poor <char>Alice,</char> who felt ready to sink into the earth:
        at last the <char>Gryphon</char> said to the<char> Mock Turtle</char>, "get on, old fellow! Don't be all day!" and the
        <char>Mock Turtle</char> went on in these words: </p>
    <p> "You may not have lived much under the sea—" ("I haven't," said<char> Alice</char>,) "and perhaps you
        were never even introduced to a lobster—" (<char>Alice</char> began to say "I once tasted—" but hastily
        checked herself, and said "no, never," instead,) "so you can have no idea what a delightful
        thing a Lobster Quadrille is!" </p>
    <p> "No, indeed," said <char>Alice</char>, "what sort of a thing is it?" </p>
    <p> "Why," said the <char>Gryphon</char>, "you form into a line along the sea shore—" </p>
    <p> "Two lines!" cried the<char> Mock Turtle,</char> "seals, turtles, salmon, and so on—advance twice—" </p>
    <p> "Each with a lobster as partner!" cried the <char>Gryphon</char>. </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_082.jpg"/>
    <p>
        
    </p>
    <p> "Of course," the <char>Mock Turtle</char> said, "advance twice, set to partners—" </p>
    <p> "Change lobsters, and retire in same order—" interrupted the<char> Gryphon</char>. </p>
    <p> "Then, you know," continued the Mock Turtle, "you throw the—" </p>
    <p> "The lobsters!" shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air. </p>
    <p> "As far out to sea as you can—" </p>
    <p> "Swim after them!" screamed the <char>Gryphon</char>. </p>
    <p> "Turn a somersault in the sea!" cried the <char>Mock Turtle</char>, capering wildly about. </p>
    <p> "Change lobsters again!" yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice, "and then—" </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_084.jpg"/>
    <p> "That's all," said the<cha> Mock Turtle</cha>, suddenly dropping its voice, and the two creatures, who
        had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly and quietly,
        and looked at <char>Alice</char>. </p>
    <p> "It must be a very pretty dance," said <char>Alice</char> timidly. </p>
    <p> "Would you like to see a little of it?" said the <char>Mock Turtle.</char> </p>
    <p> "Very much indeed," said <char>Alice</char>. </p>
    <p> "Come, let's try the first figure!" said the<char> Mock Turtle</char> to the<char> Gryphon</char>, "we can do it without lobsters, you
        know. Which shall sing?" </p>
    <p> "Oh! <uline>you</uline> sing!" said the <char>Gryphon</char>, "I've forgotten the words." </p>
    <p> So they began solemnly dancing round and round <char>Alice</char>, every now and then treading on her
        toes when they came too close, and waving their fore-paws to mark the time, while the <char>Mock
        Turtle </char>sang, slowly and sadly, these words: </p>
    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <l indent="i0">"Beneath the waters of the sea</l>
            <l indent="i0">Are lobsters thick as thick can be—</l>
            <l indent="i0">They love to dance with you and me,</l>
            <l indent="i2">My own, my gentle Salmon!"</l>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p> The <char>Gryphon</char> joined in singing the chorus, which was: </p>
    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <l indent="i0">"Salmon come up! Salmon go down!</l>
            <l indent="i0">Salmon come twist your tail around!</l>

            <l indent="i2">There's none so good as Salmon!"</l>
            
        </div>
    </div>
    <p> "Thank you," said <char>Alice</char>, feeling very glad that the figure was over. </p>
    <p> "Shall we try the second figure?" said the <char>Gryphon</char>, "or would you prefer a song?" </p>
    <p> "Oh, a song, please!" <char>Alice</char> replied, so eagerly, that the <char>Gryphon</char> said, in a rather offended
        tone, "hm! no accounting for tastes! Sing her 'Mock Turtle Soup', will you, old fellow!" </p>
    <p> The<char> Mock Turtle </char>sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked with sobs, to sing
        this: </p>
    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <l indent="i0">"Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,</l>

            <l indent="i4">Beautiful beautiful Soup!</l>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p> "Chorus again!" cried the <char>Gryphon</char>, and the <char>Mock Turtle</char> had just begun to repeat it, when a cry of "the trial's
        beginning!" was heard in the distance. </p>
    <p> "Come on!" cried the <char>Gryphon</char>, and, taking <char>Alice</char> by the hand, he hurried off, without waiting
        for the end of the song. </p>
    <p> "What trial is it?" panted <char>Alice</char> as she ran, but the<char> Gryphon </char>only answered "come on!" and
        ran the faster, and more and more faintly came, borne on the breeze that followed them, the
        melancholy words: </p>
    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <l indent="i0">"Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,</l>

        </div>
    </div>
    <p> The <char>King and Queen</char> were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a great crowd
        assembled around them: the Knave was in custody: and before<char> the Kin</char>g stood the<char> white rabbit</char>,
        with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_087.jpg"/>
    <p>
        
    </p>
    <p> "Herald! read the accusation!" said the <char>King</char>. </p>
    <p> On this the <char>white rabbit </char>blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment
        scroll, and read as follows: </p>
    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <l indent="i0">"The Queen of Hearts she made some tarts</l>
            <l indent="i2">All on a summer day:</l>
            <l indent="i0">The Knave of Hearts he stole those tarts,</l>
            <l indent="i2">And took them quite away!"</l>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p> "Now for the evidence," said <char>the King</char>, "and then the sentence." </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_088.jpg"/>
    <p> "No!" said <char>the Queen</char>, "first the sentence, and then the evidence!" </p>
    <p> "Nonsense!" cried <char>Alice</char>, so loudly that everybody jumped, "the idea of having the sentence
        first!" </p>
    <p> "Hold your tongue!" said <char>the Queen</char>. </p>
    <p> "I won't!" said <char>Alice</char>, "you're nothing but a pack of cards! Who cares for you?" </p>
    <p> At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she gave a
        little scream of fright, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with
        her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some leaves that had fluttered
        down from the trees on to her face.
    </p>
    <p> "Wake up! <char>Alice</char> dear!" said her sister, "what a nice long sleep you've had!" </p>
    <p> "Oh, I've had such a curious dream!" said <char>Alice</char>, and she told her sister all her Adventures
        Under Ground, as you have read them, and when she had finished, her sister kissed her and said
        "it <uline>was</uline> a curious dream, dear, certainly! But now run in to your tea:
        it's getting late." </p>
    <p> So <char>Alice</char> ran off, thinking while she ran (as well she might) what a wonderful dream it had
        been. </p>
    
    <p> But her sister sat there some while longer, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little
        Alice and her Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream: </p>
    <p> She saw an ancient city, and a quiet river winding near it along the plain, and up the
        stream went slowly gliding a boat with a merry party of children on board—she could hear their
        voices and laughter like music over the water—and among them was another little Alice, who sat
        listening with bright eager eyes to a tale that was being told, and she listened for the words
        of the tale, and lo! it was the dream of her own little sister. So the boat wound slowly along, beneath the
        bright summer-day, with its merry crew and its music of voices and laughter, till it passed
        round one of the many turnings of the stream, and she saw it no more. </p>
    <p> Then she thought, (in a dream within the dream, as it were,) how this same little Alice
        would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman: and how she would keep, through her riper
        years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather around her other
        little children, and make <uline>their</uline> eyes bright and eager with many a
