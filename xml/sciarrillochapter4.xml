    <p><litdev type= "personification "> A large rose tree stood near the entrance of the garden</litdev>: the roses on it were white, but
        there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red. This<char  species="human"> Alice</char> thought a very curious
        thing, and she went near to watch them, and just as she came up she heard one of them say
        <quote>"look out, Five! Don't go splashing paint over me like that!" </quote></p>
    <p> <quote>"I couldn't help it,"</quote> said <char species="nonhuman">Five</char> in a sulky tone, <quote>"Seven jogged my elbow."</quote> </p>
    <p> On which <char species="nonhuman">Seven</char> lifted up his head and <xpres>said </xpres>"that's right, Five! Always lay the blame on
        others!" </p>
    <p> "<uline>You'd</uline> better not talk!" said Five, <quote>"I heard the Queen say only yesterday she thought
        of having you beheaded!" </quote></p>
    <p><quote> "What for?" </quote>said the one who had spoken first. </p>
    <p> "That's not your business, Two!" said <char species="nonhuman">Seven.</char> </p>
    <p><quote> "Yes, it <uline>is</uline> his business!"</quote> said <char species="nonhuman">Five</char>,<quote> "and I'll tell him: it was for
        bringing in tulip-roots to the cook instead of potatoes." </quote></p>
    <p> <char species="nonhuman">Seven </char>flung down his brush, and had just begun <quote>"well! Of all the unjust things—"</quote> when his
        eye fell upon <char species="human">Alice</char>, and he stopped suddenly; the others looked round, and all of them took
        off their hats and bowed low. </p>
    <p> <quote>"Would you tell me, please,"</quote> <xpres>said </xpres><char  species="human">Alice</char> timidly, <quote>"why you are painting those roses?" </quote></p>
    <p> Five and Seven looked at Two, but said nothing: Two began, in a low voice, <quote>"why, Miss, the
        fact is, this ought to have been a red rose tree, and we put a white one in by mistake, and if
        the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off. So, you see, we're doing
        our best, before she comes, to—" At this moment Five, who had been looking anxiously across
        the garden called out <quote>"the Queen! the Queen!"</quote> </quote>and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon
        their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see <char species="human">the
        Queen</char>. </p>
    <p> First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners, flat
        and oblong, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were all
        ornamented with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came the
        Royal children: there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along, hand
        in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly kings
        and queens, among whom <char  species="human">Alice</char> recognised the <char species="nonhuman">white rabbit</char>: it was talking in a hurried nervous
        manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her. Then followed
        the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's crown on a cushion, and, last of all this grand
        procession, came <b>THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS</b>. </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_071.jpg"/>
    <p> When the procession came opposite to <char  species="human">Alice</char>, they all stopped and looked at her, and <char species="human">the Queen</char> <xpres>said </xpres>severely<quote> "who
        is this?" </quote>She <xpres>said</xpres> it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply. </p>
    <p><quote> "Idiot!"</quote> <xpres>said </xpres><char species="human" >the Queen</char>, turning up her nose, and asked Alice "what's your name?" </p>
    <p> <quote>"My name is <char species="human">Alice</char>, so please your Majesty,"</quote> <xpres>said </xpres><char  species="human">Alice</char> boldly, for she thought to herself
       <quote> "why, they're only a pack of cards! I needn't be afraid of them!"</quote> </p>
    <p> <quote>"Who are these?" </quote><xpres>said</xpres> the <char species="human">Queen</char>, pointing to the<char species="nonhuman"> three gardeners</char> lying round the rose tree,
        for, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the
        rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers,
        or three of her own children. </p>
    <p> <quote>"How should <uline>I</uline> know?"</quote> <xpres>sai</xpres>d <char  species="human">Alice</char>, surprised at her own courage, "it's
        no business of <uline>mine</uline>." </p>
    <p> The <char species="human">Queen </char>turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a minute, began in a voice
        of thunder "off with her—" </p>
    <p> <quote>"Nonsense!" </quote>said <char  species="human">Alice</char>, very loudly and decidedly, and <char species="human">the Queen</char> was silent. </p>
    <p> <char  species="human">The King</char> laid his hand upon her arm, and <xpres>said</xpres> timidly "remember, my dear! She is only a
        child!"
    </p>
    <p> <char  species="human">The Queen</char> turned angrily away from him, and <xpres>said </xpres>to the Knave <quote>"turn them over!"</quote> </p>
    <p> The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot. </p>
    <p> <quote>"Get up!"</quote> <xpres>said</xpres> <char  species="human">the Queen</char>, in a shrill loud voice, and the <char species="nonhuman">three gardeners</char> instantly jumped
        up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen, the Royal children, and everybody else. </p>
    <p> <quote>"Leave off that!" </quote><xpres>screamed</xpres> <char  species="human">the Queen</char>, "you make me giddy." And then, turning to the rose
        tree, she went on "what <uline>have</uline> you been doing here?" </p>
    <p> <quote>"May it please your Majesty,"</quote> <xpres>said </xpres>Two very humbly, going down on one knee as he spoke,<quote> "we
        were trying—"</quote> </p>
    <p> <quote>"I see!" </quote><xpres>said</xpres> <char species="human">the Queen</char>, who had meantime been examining the roses,<quote> "off with their heads!"</quote>
        and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the three
        unfortunate gardeners, who ran to <char  species="human">Alice</char> for protection. </p>
    <p><quote> "You sha'n't be beheaded!"</quote> <xpres>said</xpres> <char  species="human">Alice</char>, and she put them into her pocket: the <char>three soldiers</char>
        marched once round her, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the others. </p>
    <p> <quote>"Are their heads off?"</quote> <xpres>shouted </xpres><char species="human">the Queen</char>. </p>
    <p> <quote>"Their heads are gone," </quote><char species="nonhuman">the soldiers </char>shouted in reply,<quote> "if it please your Majesty!"</quote>
    </p>
    <p><quote> "That's right!" </quote>shouted <char  species="human">the Queen</char>, <quote>"can you play croquet?"</quote> </p>
    <p> <char species="nonhuman">The soldiers</char> were silent, and looked at <char  species="human">Alice</char>, as the question was evidently meant for her. </p>
    <p><quote> "Yes!"</quote> <xpres>shouted </xpres><char  species="human">Alice</char> at the top of her voice. </p>
    <p> <quote>"Come on then!" </quote><xpres>roared</xpres> <char  species="human">the Queen</char>, and<char  species="human"> Alice </char>joined the procession, wondering very much what
        would happen next. </p>
    <p><quote> "It's—it's a very fine day!"</quote> <xpres>said </xpres>a timid little voice: she was walking by the white rabbit,
        who was peeping anxiously into her face. </p>
    <p> <quote>"Very," </quote><xpres>said </xpres><char  species="human">Alice</char>, "where's the Marchioness?" </p>
    <p><quote> "Hush, hush!"</quote> <xpres>said </xpres><char species="nonhuman">the rabbit</char> in a low voice, <quote>"she'll hear you. The Queen's the Marchioness:
        didn't you know that?"</quote> </p>
    <p><quote> "No, I didn't," </quote><xpres>said</xpres> <char  species="human">Alice</char>, <quote>"what of?"</quote> </p>
    <p> "Queen of Hearts," <xpres>said</xpres> <char species="nonhuman">the rabbit</char> in a whisper, putting its mouth close to her ear<quote>, "and
        Marchioness of <char species="nonhuman">Mock Turtles</char>."</quote> </p>
    <p> "What are <uline>they</uline>?" <xpres>said</xpres><char  species="human"> Alice</char>, but there was no time for the answer,
        for they had reached the croquet-ground, and the game began instantly. </p>
    <p> <char  species="human">Alice </char>thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in all her life: it was all
        in ridges and furrows: the croquet-balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live ostriches, and
        the soldiers had to double themselves up, and stand on their feet and hands, to make the arches. </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_075.jpg"/>
    <p> The chief difficulty which <char  species="human">Alice</char> found at first was to manage her ostrich: she got its body
        tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally,
        just as she had got its neck straightened out nicely, and was going to give a blow with its
        head, it <uline>would</uline> twist itself round, and look up into her face, with such
        a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had got its
        head down, and was going to begin again, it was very confusing to find that the hedgehog had
        unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was generally a
        ridge or a furrow in her way, wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and as the
        doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, <char  species="human">Alice</char> soon came to the
        conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed. </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_076.jpg"/>
    <p> The players all played at once without waiting for turns, and quarrelled all the while at
        the tops of their voices, and in a very few minutes <char  species="human">the Queen</char> was in a furious passion, and
        went stamping about and shouting "off with his head!" of "off with her head!" about once in a
        minute. All those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course
        had to leave off being arches to do this, so that, by the end of half an hour or so, there
        were no arches left, and all the players, except <char species="human">the King</char>, <char species="human">the Queen</char>, and <char species="human">Alice</char>, were in
        custody, and under sentence of execution. </p>
    <p> Then <char species="human">the Queen </char>left off, quite out of breath, and <xpres>said</xpres> to <char species="human">Alice</char> "have you seen the Mock
        Turtle?" </p>
    <p> <quote>"No,"</quote> <xpres>said</xpres> <char  species="human">Alice,</char> <quote>"I don't even know what a<char species="nonhuman"> Mock Turtle</char> is."</quote> </p>
    <p><quote> "Come on then," <xpres>said</xpres> <char species="human">the Queen</char>, "and it shall tell you its history."</quote> </p>
    <p> As they walked off together, <char species="human">Alice</char> heard <char  species="human">the King</char> say in a low voice, to the company
        generally,<quote> "you are all pardoned." </quote></p>
    <p><quote> "Come, that's a good thing!" </quote>thought <char species="human">Alice</char>, who had felt quite grieved at the number of executions which<char species="human"> the Queen</char>
        had ordered. </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_078.jpg"/>
    <p> They very soon came upon a Gryphon, which lay fast asleep in the sun: (if you don't know
        what a Gryphon is, look at the picture):<quote> "Up, lazy thing!" </quote>said <char  species="human">the Queen</char>, "and take this
        young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to hear its history. I must go back and see after some
        executions I ordered," and she walked off, leaving<char  species="human"> Alice</char> with the <char species="nonhuman">Gryphon.</char> <char  species="human">Alice</char> did not quite
        like the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it quite as safe to stay as to go
        after that savage Queen: so she waited. </p>
    <p> The <char species="nonhuman">Gryphon </char>sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched<char  species="human"> the Queen</char> till she was out of sight:
        then it chuckled. "What fun!" <xpres>said </xpres>the <char species="nonhuman">Gryphon</char>, half to itself, half to <char species="human">Alice.</char> </p>
    <p> "What <uline>is</uline> the fun?" <xpres>said</xpres> <char  species="human">Alice</char>. </p>
    <p> "Why, <uline>she</uline>," said the<char species="nonhuman"> Gryphon</char>; "it's all her fancy, that: they never
        executes nobody, you know: come on!"
    </p>
    <p> <quote>"Everybody says 'come on!' here,"</quote> thought <char  species="human">Alice </char>as she walked slowly after the <char species="nonhuman">Gryphon</char>; "I
        never was ordered about so before in all my life—never!" </p>
    <p> They had not gone far before they saw the <char species="nonhuman">Mock Turtle</char> in the distance, sitting sad and
        lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, <char  species="human">Alice</char> could here it sighing as if
        its heart would break. She pitied it deeply: "what is its sorrow?" she asked the Gryphon, and
        the <char species="nonhuman">Gryphon </char>answered, very nearly in the same words as before, "it's all its fancy, that: it
        hasn't got no sorrow, you know: come on!" </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_079.jpg"/>
    <p> So they went up to the<char species="nonhuman"> Mock Turtle</char>, who looked at them with large eyes full of tears, but
        said nothing. </p>
    <p> "This here young lady" said the <char species="nonhuman">Gryphon</char>, "wants for to know your history, she do." </p>
    <p> "<quote>I'll tell it,"</quote> said the <char species="nonhuman">Mock Turtle</char>, in a deep hollow tone, "sit down, and don't speak till
        I've finished." </p>
    <p> So they sat down, and no one spoke for some minutes: <char species="human">Alice</char> thought to herself "I don't see
        how it can <uline>ever</uline> finish, if it doesn't begin," but she waited patiently. </p>
    <p><quote> "Once," </quote>said the <char species="nonhuman">Mock Turtle</char> at last, with a deep sigh,<quote> "I was a real Turtle."</quote> </p>
    <p> These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation
        of "hjckrrh!" from the <char species="nonhuman">Gryphon</char>, and the constant heavy sobbing of the <char species="nonhuman"> Mock Turtle</char>. <char species="human">Alice</char> was
        very nearly getting up and saying, "thank you, sir, for your interesting story," but she could
        not help thinking there <uline>must</uline> be more to come, so she sat still and said
        nothing. </p>
    <p><quote> "When we were little,"</quote> the <char species="nonhuman">Mock Turtle</char> went on, more calmly, though still sobbing a little
        now and then, "we went to school in the sea. The master was an old Turtle—we used to call him
        Tortoise—" </p>
    <p> "Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?" asked<char  species="human"> Alice.</char>
    </p>
    <p> <quote>"We called him Tortoise because he taught us," </quote><xpres>said</xpres> the <char species="nonhuman">Mock Turtle</char> angrily, "really you are
        very dull!" </p>
    <p> <quote>"You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question," </quote>added the <char species="nonhuman">Gryphon</char>,
        and then they both sat silent and looked at poor <char  species="human">Alice,</char> who felt ready to sink into the earth:
        at last the <char species="nonhuman">Gryphon</char> <xpres>said</xpres> to the<char> Mock Turtle</char>, <quote>"get on, old fellow! Don't be all day!"</quote> and the
        <char species="nonhuman">Mock Turtle</char> went on in these words: </p>
    <p><quote> "You may not have lived much under the sea—"</quote> ("I haven't,"<xpres> said</xpres><char species="human"> Alice</char>,) "and perhaps you
        were never even introduced to a lobster—" (<char species="human">Alice</char> began to say "I once tasted—" but hastily
        checked herself, and <xpres>said</xpres> "no, never," instead,) "so you can have no idea what a delightful
        thing a Lobster Quadrille is!" </p>
    <p> "No, indeed," <xpres>said </xpres><char  species="human">Alice</char>, "what sort of a thing is it?" </p>
    <p> "Why," <xpres>said</xpres> the <char>Gryphon</char>, "you form into a line along the sea shore—" </p>
    <p> "Two lines!" cried the<char species="nonhuman"> Mock Turtle,</char> "seals, turtles, salmon, and so on—advance twice—" </p>
    <p> "Each with a lobster as partner!" cried the <char species="nonhuman">Gryphon</char>. </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_082.jpg"/>
    <p>
        
    </p>
    <p> <quote>"Of course,"</quote> the <char species="nonhuman">Mock Turtle</char> <xpres>said</xpres>, <quote>"advance twice, set to partners—"</quote> </p>
    <p> <quote>"Change lobsters, and retire in same order—" </quote>interrupted the<char species="nonhuman"> Gryphon</char>. </p>
    <p> <quote>"Then, you know," continued the Mock Turtle, "you throw the—" </quote></p>
    <p> "The lobsters!" shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air. </p>
    <p><quote> "As far out to sea as you can—"</quote> </p>
    <p> <quote>"Swim after them!"</quote> screamed the <char species="nonhuman">Gryphon</char>. </p>
    <p> <quote>"Turn a somersault in the sea!" </quote>cried the <char species="nonhuman">Mock Turtle</char>, capering wildly about. </p>
    <p> <quote>"Change lobsters again!" </quote>yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice, "and then—" </p>
    <image source="au-images/image_084.jpg"/>
    <p> "That's all," <xpres>said </xpres>the<cha> Mock Turtle</cha>, suddenly dropping its voice, and the two creatures, who
        had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly and quietly,
        and looked at <char species="human">Alice</char>. </p>
    <p> <quote>"It must be a very pretty dance,"</quote> said <char  species="human">Alice</char> timidly. </p>
    <p><quote> "Would you like to see a little of it?"</quote> <xpres>said </xpres>the <char species="nonhuman">Mock Turtle.</char> </p>
    <p><quote> "Very much indeed," </quote>said <char  species="human">Alice</char>. </p>
    <p> <quote>"Come, let's try the first figure!"</quote> said the<char species="nonhuman"> Mock Turtle</char> to the<char species="nonhuman"> Gryphon</char>, "we can do it without lobsters, you
        know. Which shall sing?" </p>
    <p><quote> "Oh! <uline>you</uline> sing!"<xpres> said</xpres> the <char species="nonhuman">Gryphon</char>, "I've forgotten the words."</quote> </p>
    <p> So they began solemnly dancing round and round <char  species="human">Alice</char>, every now and then treading on her
        toes when they came too close, and waving their fore-paws to mark the time, while the <char species="nonhuman">Mock
        Turtle </char>sang, slowly and sadly, these words: </p>

        </div>
    </div>
    <p> The <char species="nonhuman">Gryphon</char> joined in singing the chorus, which was: </p>

    <p><quote> <quote>"Thank you,</quote>"</quote> <xpres>said</xpres> <char species="human">Alice</char>, feeling very glad that the figure was over. </p>
    <p> "Shall we try the second figure?" <xpres>said </xpres>the <char species="nonhuman">Gryphon</char>, <quote>"or would you prefer a song?"</quote> </p>
    <p> <quote>"Oh, a song, please!" </quote><char>Alice</char> replied, so eagerly, that the <char species="nonhuman">Gryphon</char> <xpres>said</xpres>, in a rather offended
        tone, "hm! no accounting for tastes! Sing her 'Mock Turtle Soup', will you, old fellow!" </p>
    <p> The<char species="nonhuman"> Mock Turtle </char>sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked with <xpres>sobs</xpres>, to sing
        this: </p>
    <div class="poem">

    <p> <quote>"Chorus again!"</quote> cried the <char species="nonhuman">Gryphon</char>, and the <char species="nonhuman">Mock Turtle</char> had just begun to repeat it, when a cry of "the trial's
        beginning!" was heard in the distance. </p>
    <p> "Come on!" cried the <char>Gryphon</char>, and, taking <char  species="human">Alice</char> by the hand, he hurried off, without waiting
        for the end of the song. </p>
    <p> "What trial is it?" panted <char  species="human">Alice</char> as she ran, but the<char species="nonhuman"> Gryphon </char>only answered "come on!" and
        ran the faster, and more and more faintly came, borne on the breeze that followed them, the
        melancholy words: </p>

    <p> The <char species="human">King and Queen</char> were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a great crowd

    <p> On this the <char species="nonhuman">white rabbit </char>blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment
        scroll, and read as follows: </p>
    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <l indent="i0">"The Queen of Hearts she made some tarts</l>
            <l indent="i2">All on a summer day:</l>
            <l indent="i0">The Knave of Hearts he stole those tarts,</l>
            <l indent="i2">And took them quite away!"</l>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p> "Now for the evidence," said <char  species="human">the King</char>, <quote>"and then the sentence." </quote></p>
    <image source="au-images/image_088.jpg"/>
    <p> "No!" <xpres>said</xpres> <char species="human">the Queen</char>, "first the sentence, and then the evidence!" </p>
    <p> "Nonsense!" cried <char species="human">Alice</char>, so loudly that everybody jumped, "the idea of having the sentence
        first!" </p>
    <p> <quote>"Hold your tongue!" </quote><xpres>said </xpres><char  species="human">the Queen</char>. </p>
    <p> <quote>"I won't!"</quote> said <char  species="human">Alice</char>, "you're nothing but a pack of cards! Who cares for you?" </p>
    <p> At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she gave a
        little scream of fright, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with
        her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some leaves that had fluttered
        down from the trees on to her face.
    </p>
    <p> "Wake up! <char species="human">Alice</char> dear!" <xpres>said </xpres>her sister,<quote> "what a nice long sleep you've had!"</quote> </p>
    <p> "Oh, I've had such a curious dream!" <xpres>said </xpres><char  species="human">Alice</char>, and she told her sister all her Adventures
        Under Ground, as you have read them, and when she had finished, her sister kissed her and said
        "it <uline>was</uline> a curious dream, dear, certainly! But now run in to your tea:
        it's getting late." </p>
    <p> So <char  species="human">Alice</char> ran off, thinking while she ran (as well she might) what a wonderful dream it had
        been. </p>
    
    <p> But her sister sat there some while longer, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little
        <char  species="human">Alice </char>and her Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream: </p>
    <p> <yap>She saw an ancient city, and a quiet river winding near it along the plain, and up the
        stream went slowly gliding a boat with a merry party of children on board—she could hear their
        voices and laughter like music over the water—and among them was another little Alice, who sat
        listening with bright eager eyes to a tale that was being told, and she listened for the words
        of the tale, and lo! it was the dream of her own little sister. So the boat wound slowly along, beneath the
        bright summer-day, with its merry crew and its music of voices and laughter, till it passed
        round one of the many turnings of the stream, and she saw it no more.</yap> </p>
    <p> Then she thought, (in a dream within the dream, as it were,) how this same little Alice
        would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman: and how she would keep, through her riper
        years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather around her other
        little children, and make <uline>their</uline> eyes bright and eager with many a
        wonderful tale, perhaps even with these very adventures of the little Alice of long-ago: and
        how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple
        joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days. </p>
