            <h2 class="chapterHeading"> Chapter I </h2>
            
            <div class="p"> <span class="character">Alice</span> was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her <span class="character">sister</span> on the bank, and of having
               nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her <span class="character">sister</span> was reading, but it had
               no pictures or conversations in it, and where is the use of a book, thought <span class="character">Alice</span>, without
               pictures or conversations? So she was considering in her own mind, (as well as she
               could, for
               the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid,) whether the pleasure of making
               a
               daisy-chain was worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when a white
               <span class="character">rabbit</span>
               with pink eyes ran close by her. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> There was nothing very remarkable in that, nor did <span class="character">Alice</span> think it so very much out of the
               way to hear the <span class="character">rabbit</span> say to itself "dear, dear! I shall be too late!" (when she thought it
               over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at
               the time
               it all seemed quite natural); but when the <span class="character">rabbit</span> actually <em>took a watch out of
                  its waistcoat-pocket</em>, looked at it, and then hurried on, <span class="character">Alice</span> started to her feet,
               for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either
               a waistcoat-pocket or a watch to take
               out of it, and, full of curiosity, she hurried across the field after it, and was
               just in time
               to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge. In a moment down went <span class="character">Alice</span> after it,
               never once considering how in the world she was to get out again. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly
               down,
               so suddenly, that <span class="character">Alice</span> had not a moment to think about stopping herself, before she found
               herself falling down what seemed a deep well. Either the well was very deep, or she
               fell very
               slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her, and to wonder
               what
               would happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming
               to, but it
               was too dark to see anything: then, she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed
               that they
               were filled with cupboards and book-shelves: here and there were maps and pictures
               hung on
               pegs.  </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Well!" thought <span class="character">Alice</span> to herself, "after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of
               tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say
               anything
               about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!" (which was most likely true.)
               </div>
            
            <div class="p"> Down, down, down. Would the fall <em>never</em> come to an end? "I wonder how
               many miles I've fallen by this time?" she said aloud, "I must be getting somewhere
               near the
               centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—"
               (for you
               see <span class="character">Alice</span> had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though
               this was not a <em>very</em> good opportunity of showing off her knowledge, as
               there was no one to hear her, still it was good practice to say it over,) "yes that's
               the
               right distance, but then what Longitude or Latitude-line shall I be in?" (Alice had
               no
               idea what Longitude was, or
               Latitude either, but she thought they were nice grand words to say.) </div>
            
            <div class="p">  </div>
            
            <div class="p"> Down, down, down: there was nothing else to do, so <span class="character">Alice</span> soon began talking again. "<span class="character">Dinah</span>
               will miss me very much tonight, I should think!" (<span class="character">Dinah</span> was the cat.) "I hope they'll remember
               her saucer of milk at tea-time! Oh, dear <span class="character">Dinah</span>, I wish I had you here! There are no mice in
               the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you
               know, my
               dear. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?"   </div>
            
            <div class="p"> <span class="character">Alice</span> was not a bit hurt, and jumped on to her feet directly: she looked up, but it was
               all
               dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the white rabbit was still
               in sight,
               hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went <span class="character">Alice</span> like the wind, and just
               heard it say, as it turned a corner, "my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!"
               She turned
               the corner after it, and instantly found herself in a long, low hall, lit up by a
               row of lamps
               which hung from the roof. </div>
            
            
            <div class="p"> There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked, and when <span class="character">Alice</span> had been all
               round it, and tried them all, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she
               was ever to get out again: suddenly
               she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing
               lying
               upon it, but a tiny golden key, and <span class="character">Alice</span>'s first idea was that it might belong to one of the
               doors of the hall, but alas! either the locks were too large, or the key too small,
               but at any
               rate it would open none of them. However, on the second time round, she came to a
               low curtain,
               behind which was a door about eighteen inches high: she tried the little key in the
               keyhole,
               and it fitted! <span class="character">Alice</span> opened the door, and looked down a small passage, not larger than a
               rat-hole, into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that
               dark hall,
               and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but
               she could
               not even get her head through the doorway, "and even if my head would go through,"
               thought
               poor <span class="character">Alice</span>, "it would be very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up
               like a telescope! I
               think I could, if I only knew how to begin." For, you see, so many out-of-the-way
               things had
               happened lately, that <span class="character">Alice</span> began to think very few things indeed were really impossible. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> There was nothing else to do, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might
               find
               another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting up people like telescopes:
               this
               time there was a little bottle on it—"which certainly was not there before" said <span class="character">Alice</span>—and
               tied round the neck of the bottle was a paper label with the words DRINK ME beautifully
               printed on it in large letters. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> It was all very well to say "drink me," "but I'll look first," said the wise little
               <span class="character">Alice</span>,
               "and see whether the bottle's marked "poison" or not," for <span class="character">Alice</span> had read several nice little
               stories about children that got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts, and other unpleasant
               things, because they <em>would</em> not remember the simple rules their friends
               had given them, such as, that, if you get into the fire, it will burn you, and that,
               if you
               cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it generally bleeds, and she had never forgotten
               that, if you drink a
               bottle marked "poison," it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.
               </div>
            
            <div class="p"> However, this bottle was <em>not</em> marked poison, so <span class="character">Alice</span> tasted it, and
               finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard,
               pine-apple, roast turkey, toffy, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it
               off. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "What a curious feeling!" said <span class="character">Alice</span>, "I must be shutting up like a telescope." </div>
            
            <div class="p"> It was so indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up as
               it
               occurred to her that she was now the right size for going through the little door
               into that
               lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see whether she was
               going to
               shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this, "for it might end, you know,"
               said
               <span class="character">Alice</span> to herself, "in my going out altogether, like a candle, and what should I be like
               then,
               I wonder?" and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle
               is blown out, for she could not
               remember having ever seen one. However, nothing more happened so she decided on going
               into the
               garden at once, but, alas for poor <span class="character">Alice</span>! when she got to the door, she found she had
               forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for the key,
               she found
               she could not possibly reach it: she could see it plainly enough through the glass,
               and she
               tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery,
               and when she
               had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried. </div>
            
            
            <div class="p"> "Come! there's no use in crying!" said <span class="character">Alice</span> to herself rather sharply, "I advise you to
               leave off this minute!" (she generally gave herself very good advice, and sometimes
               scolded
               herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes,  </div>
            
            <div class="p"> Soon her eyes fell on a little ebony box lying under the table: she opened it, and
               found in
               it a very small cake, on which was lying a card with the words EAT ME beautifully
               printed on it in large letters. "I'll eat," said <span class="character">Alice</span>, "and if it makes me larger, I can
               reach the key, and if it makes me smaller, I can creep under the door, so either way
               I'll get
               into the garden, and I don't care which happens!" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself "which way? which way?" and laid
               her
               hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and was quite surprised
               to find
               that she remained the same size: to be sure this is what generally happens when one
               eats cake,
               but Alice had got into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the way things to happen,
               and
               it seemed quite dull and stupid for things to go on in the common way. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Curiouser and curiouser!" cried <span class="character">Alice</span>, (she was so surprised that she quite forgot how to
               speak good English,) "now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was!
               Goodbye,
               feet!" (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed almost out of sight, they
               were
               getting so far off,)  </div>
            
            
            <div class="p"> 
               </div>
            
            <div class="p"> oh dear! what nonsense I am talking!" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> Just at this moment, her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact, she was
               now
               rather more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key, and
               hurried
               off to the garden door. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> Poor <span class="character">Alice</span>! it was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the
               garden with one eye, but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down
               and cried
               again. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "You ought to be ashamed of yourself," said <span class="character">Alice</span>, "a great girl like you," (she might well
               say this,) "to cry in this way! Stop this instant, I tell you!" But she cried on all
               the same,
               shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool, about four inches deep, all
               round
               her, and reaching half way across the hall. After a time, she heard a little pattering
               of feet
               in the distance, and dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the white <span class="character">rabbit</span> coming back again, splendidly
               dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand, and a nosegay in the other.
               <span class="character">Alice</span> was
               ready to ask help of any one, she felt so desperate, and as the <span class="character">rabbit</span> passed her, she said,
               in a low, timid voice, "If you please, Sir—" the <span class="character">rabbit</span> started violently, looked up once into
               the roof of the hall, from which the voice seemed to come, and then dropped the nosegay
               and
               the white kid gloves, and skurried away into the darkness, as hard as it could go.
               </div>
            
            
            <div class="p"> <span class="character">Alice</span> took up the nosegay and gloves, and found the nosegay so delicious that she kept
               smelling at it all the time she went on talking to herself—"dear, dear! how queer
               everything
               is today! and yesterday everything happened just as usual: I wonder if I was changed
               in the
               night?  </div>
            
            
            <div class="p"> As she said this, she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to find she had
               put on one
               of the <span class="character">rabbit</span>'s little gloves while she was talking. "How <em>can</em> I have
               done that?" thought she, "I must be growing small again." She got up and went to the
               table to
               measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about
               two
               feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: soon she found out that the reason
               of it was
               the nosegay she held in her hand: she dropped it hastily, just in time to save herself
               from
               shrinking away altogether, and found that she was now only three inches high. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Now for the garden!" cried <span class="character">Alice</span>, as she hurried back to the little door, but the little door was locked
               again, and the little gold key was lying on the glass table as before, and "things
               are worse
               than ever!" thought the poor little girl, "for I never was as small as this before,
               never! And
               I declare it's too bad, it is!" </div>
            
            
            <div class="p"> At this moment her foot slipped, and splash! she was up to her chin in salt water.
               Her first
               idea was that she had fallen into the sea: then she remembered that she was under
               ground, and
               she soon made out that it was the pool of tears she had wept when she was nine feet
               high. "I
               wish I hadn't cried so much!" said <span class="character">Alice</span>, as she swam about, trying to find her way out, "I
               shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! Well! that'll
               be a queer thing, to be sure!
               However, every thing is queer today." Very soon she saw something splashing about
               in the pool
               near her: at first she thought it must be a walrus or a hippopotamus, but then she
               remembered
               how small she was herself, and soon made out that it was only a <span class="character">mouse</span>, that had slipped in
               like herself. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Would it be any use, now," thought <span class="character">Alice</span>, "to speak to this <span class="character">mouse</span>? The <span class="character">rabbit</span> is something
               quite out-of-the-way, no doubt, and so have I been, ever since I came down here, but
               that is
               no reason why the <span class="character">mouse</span> should not be able to talk. I think I may as well try." </div>
            
            <div class="p"> So she began: "oh <span class="character">Mouse</span>, do you know how to get out of this pool? I am very tired of
               swimming about here, oh <span class="character">Mouse</span>!" The <span class="character">mouse</span> looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to
               her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing. </div>
            
            
            <div class="p"> "Perhaps it doesn't understand English," thought <span class="character">Alice</span>; "I daresay it's a French mouse, come
               over with William the Conqueror!" (for,with all her knowledge of history, Alice had
               no very clear notion how long
               ago anything had happened,) so she began again: "où est ma chatte?" which was the
               first
               sentence out of her French lesson-book. The <span class="character">mouse</span> gave a sudden jump in the pool, and seemed
               to quiver with fright: "oh, I beg your pardon!" cried <span class="character">Alice</span> hastily, afraid that she had hurt
               the poor animal's feelings, "I quite forgot you didn't like cats!" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Not like cats!" cried the <span class="character">mouse</span>, in a shrill, passionate voice, "would <em>you</em> like cats if you were me?" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Well, perhaps not," said <span class="character">Alice</span> in a soothing tone, "don't be angry about it. And yet I wish
               I could show you our cat <span class="character">Dinah</span>: I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.
               She is such a dear quiet thing," said <span class="character">Alice</span>, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the
               pool, "she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face:
               and she
               is such a nice soft thing to nurse, and she's such a capital one for catching mice—oh!
               I beg
               your pardon!" cried poor <span class="character">Alice</span> again, for this time the mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain
               that it was really offended, "have I offended you?" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Offended indeed!" cried the <span class="character">mouse</span>, who seemed to be positively trembling with rage, "our
               family always <em>hated</em> cats! Nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't talk to me
               about them any more!" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "I won't indeed!" said <span class="character">Alice</span>, in a great hurry to change the conversation, "are you—are
               you—fond of—dogs?" The <span class="character">mouse</span> did not answer, so <span class="character">Alice</span> went on eagerly: "there is such a nice
               little dog near our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier,
               you know,
               with oh! such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and
               it'll sit
               up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things—I ca'n't remember half of them—and
               it
               belongs to a farmer, and he says it kills all the rats and—oh dear!" said <span class="character">Alice</span> sadly, "I'm
               afraid I've offended it again!" for the <span class="character">mouse</span> was swimming away from her as hard as it could
               go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> So she called softly after it: "<span class="character">mouse</span> dear! Do come back again, and we won't talk about cats
               and dogs any more, if you don't like them!" When the <span class="character">mouse</span> heard this, it turned and swam
               slowly back to her: its face was quite pale, (with passion, <span class="character">Alice</span> thought,) and it said in a
               trembling low voice "let's get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and
               you'll
               understand why it is I hate cats and dogs." </div>
            
            <div class="p"> It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite full of birds and animals
               that had
               fallen into it. There was a <span class="character">Duck</span> and a <span class="character">Dodo</span>, a <span class="character">Lory</span> and an <span class="character">Eaglet</span>, and several other curious
               creatures. <span class="character">Alice</span> led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore. </div>

         <section class="chapter">
            
            <h2 class="chapterHeading"> Chapter II </h2>
            
            <div class="p"> They were indeed a curious looking party that assembled on the bank—the birds with
               draggled
               feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them—all dripping wet, cross,
               and
               uncomfortable. The first question of course was, how to get dry: they had a consultation
               about
               this, and <span class="character">Alice</span> hardly felt at all surprised at finding herself talking familiarly with the
               birds, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument
               with the
               <span class="character">Lory</span>, who at last turned sulky, and would only say "I am older than you, and must know
               best,"
               and this <span class="character">Alice</span> would not admit without knowing how old the <span class="character">Lory</span> was, and as the <span class="character">Lory</span>
               positively refused to tell its age, there was nothing more to be said. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> At last the <span class="character">mouse</span>, who seemed to have some authority among them, called out "sit down, all
               of you, and attend to me! I'll soon make you dry enough!" They all sat down at once,
               shivering, in a large ring, <span class="character">Alice</span> in the middle, with her eyes anxiously fixed on the <span class="character">mouse</span>,
               for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Ahem!" said the <span class="character">mouse</span>, with a self-important air, "are you all ready? This is the driest
               thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! </div>
            
            
            <div class="p"> "As wet as ever," said poor <span class="character">Alice</span>, "it doesn't seem to dry me at all." </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "In that case," said the <span class="character">Dodo</span> solemnly, rising to his feet, "I move that the meeting
               adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies—" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Speak English!" said the <span class="character">duck</span>, "I don't know the meaning of half those long words, and
               what's more, I don't believe you do either!" And the <span class="character">duck</span> quacked a comfortable laugh to
               itself. Some of the other birds tittered audibly. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "I only meant to say," said the <span class="character">dodo</span> in a rather offended tone, "that I know of a house near
               here, where we could get the young lady and the rest of the party dried, and then
               we could
               listen comfortably to the story which I think you were good enough to promise to tell
               us,"
               bowing gravely to the <span class="character">mouse</span>. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> the <span class="character">mouse</span> made no objection to this, and the whole party moved along the river bank, (for
               the pool had by this time began to flow out of the hall, and the edge of it was fringed
               with
               rushes and forget-me-nots,) in a slow procession, the <span class="character">dodo</span> leading the way. After a time the <span class="character">dodo</span> became impatient, and, leaving the <span class="character">duck</span> to bring up the rest of the party, moved on at a
               quicker pace with <span class="character">Alice</span>, the <span class="character">Lory</span>, and the <span class="character">Eaglet</span>, and soon brought them to a little cottage,
               and there they sat snugly by the fire, wrapped up in blankets, until the rest of the
               party had
               arrived, and they were all dry again. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> Then they all sat down again in a large ring on the bank, and begged the <span class="character">mouse</span> to begin his
               story. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Mine is a long and a sad tale!" said the <span class="character">mouse</span>, turning to <span class="character">Alice</span>, and sighing. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "It <em>is</em> a long tail, certainly," said <span class="character">Alice</span>, looking down with wonder
               at the <span class="character">mouse</span>'s tail, which was coiled nearly all round the party, "but why do you call it
               sad?" and she went on puzzling about this as the <span class="character">mouse</span> went on speaking, so that her idea of
               the tale was something like this: </div>
            
            
            <div class="poem">
               We lived beneath the mat

               Was the <em>cat</em>!

            <div class="p"> "You are not attending!" said the <span class="character">mouse</span> to <span class="character">Alice</span> severely, "what are you thinking of?" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "I beg your pardon," said <span class="character">Alice</span> very humbly, "you had got to the fifth bend, I think?" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "I had not!" cried the <span class="character">mouse</span>, sharply and very angrily. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "A knot!" said <span class="character">Alice</span>, always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about her,
               "oh, do let me help to undo it!" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "I shall do nothing of the sort!" said the <span class="character">mouse</span>, getting up and walking away from the
               party, "you insult me by talking such nonsense!" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "I didn't mean it!" pleaded poor <span class="character">Alice</span>, "but you're so easily offended, you know." </div>
            
            <div class="p"> the <span class="character">mouse</span> only growled in reply. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Please come back and finish your story!" <span class="character">Alice</span> called after it, and the others all joined
               in chorus "yes, please do!" but the <span class="character">mouse</span> only shook its ears, and walked quickly away, and
               was soon out of sight. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "What a pity it wouldn't stay!" sighed the <span class="character">Lory</span>, and an old Crab took the opportunity of
               saying to its daughter "Ah, my dear! let this be a lesson to you never to lose <em>your</em>
               temper!" "Hold your tongue, Ma!" said the young Crab, a little snappishly, "you're
               enough to
               try the patience of an oyster!" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "I wish I had our <span class="character">Dinah</span> here, I know I do!" said <span class="character">Alice</span> aloud, addressing no one in
               particular, "she'd soon fetch it back!" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "And who is <span class="character">Dinah</span>, if I might venture to ask the question?" said the <span class="character">Lory</span>. </div>
            
            
            <div class="p"> <span class="character">Alice</span> replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet, "<span class="character">Dinah</span>'s our cat. And
               she's such a capital one for catching mice, you can't think! And oh! I wish you could
               see her
               after the birds! Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> This answer caused a remarkable sensation among the party: some of the birds hurried
               off at
               once; one old magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking "I really
               must be
               getting home: the night air does not suit my throat," and a canary called out in a
               trembling
               voice to its children "come away from her, my dears, she's no fit company for you!"
               On various
               pretexts, they all moved off, and <span class="character">Alice</span> was soon left alone. </div>
            
            
            <div class="p"> She sat for some while sorrowful and silent, but she was not long before she recovered
               her
               spirits, and began talking to herself again as usual: "I do wish some of them had
               stayed a
               little longer! and I was getting to be such friends with them—really the <span class="character">Lory</span> and I were
               almost like sisters! and so was that dear little Eaglet! And then the <span class="character">duck</span> and the <span class="character">dodo</span>! How
               nicely the <span class="character">duck</span> sang to us as we came along through the water: and if the Dodo hadn't known
               the way to that nice little cottage, I don't know when we should have got dry again—"
               and
               there is no knowing how long she might have prattled on in this way, if she had not
               suddenly
               caught the sound of pattering feet. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> It was the white rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about
               it as it
               went, as if it had lost something, and she heard it muttering to itself "the Marchioness!
               the
               Marchioness! oh my dear paws! oh my fur and whiskers! She'll have me executed, as
               sure as
               ferrets are ferrets!
               Where <em>can</em> I have dropped them, I wonder?" <span class="character">Alice</span> guessed in a moment
               that it was looking for the nosegay and the pair of white kid gloves, and she began
               hunting
               for them, but they were now nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since
               her
               swim in the pool, and her walk along the river-bank with its fringe of rushes and
               forget-me-nots, and the glass table and the little door had vanished. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> Soon <span class="character">rabbit</span> noticed <span class="character">Alice</span>, as she stood looking curiously about her, and at once said in
               a quick angry tone, "why, Mary Ann! what <em>are</em> you doing out here? Go
               home this moment, and look on my dressing-table for my gloves and nosegay, and fetch
               them
               here, as quick as you can run, do you hear?" and <span class="character">Alice</span> was so much frightened that she ran off
               at once, without saying a
               word, in the direction which <span class="character">rabbit</span> had pointed out. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> She soon found herself in front of a neat little house, on the door of which was
               a bright
               brass plate with the name W. RABBIT, ESQ. She went in, and hurried upstairs, for fear
               she should meet the real Mary Ann and be turned out of the house before she had found
               the
               gloves: she knew that one pair had been lost in the hall, "but of course," thought
               <span class="character">Alice</span>, "it
               has plenty more of them in its house. How queer it seems to be going messages for
               a rabbit! I
               suppose <span class="character">Dinah</span>'ll be sending me messages next!"  </div>
            
            
            <div class="p"> By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room, with a table in the window
               on
               which was a looking-glass and, (as <span class="character">Alice</span> had hoped,) two or three pairs of tiny white kid
               gloves: she took up a pair of gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her
               eye fell
               upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass: there was no label on it this
               time
               with the words "drink me," but nonetheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips:
               "I know
               something interesting is sure to happen," she said to herself, "whenever I eat or
               drink
               anything, so I'll see what this bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow larger,
               for I'm
               quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> It did so indeed, and much sooner than she expected: before she had drunk half the
               bottle, she found her
               head pressing against the ceiling, and she stooped to save her neck from being broken,
               and
               hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself "that's quite enough—I hope I sha'n't
               grow any
               more—I wish I hadn't drunk so much!" </div>
            
            
            <div class="p"> Alas! it was too late: she went on growing and growing, and very soon had to kneel
               down: in
               another minute there was not room even for this, and she tried the effect of lying
               down, with
               one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head. Still she went
               on
               growing, and as a last resource she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up
               the
               chimney, and said to herself "now I can do no more—what <em>will</em> become of
               me?" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> Luckily for <span class="character">Alice</span>, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no
               larger; still it was very uncomfortable, and as there seemed to be no sort of chance
               of ever
               getting out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy. "It was much pleasanter
               at home,"
               thought poor <span class="character">Alice</span>, "when one wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered
               about by mice and rabbits—I almost wish I hadn't gone down that rabbit-hole, and yet,
               and
               yet—it's rather curious, you know, this sort of life. I do wonder what <em>can</em> have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that sort of
               thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There ought to be a
               book written
               about me, that there ought! and when I grow up I'll write one—but I'm grown up now"
               said she
               in a sorrowful tone, "at least there's no room to grow up any more <em>here</em>." </div>
            
            
            <div class="p"> "But then," thought <span class="character">Alice</span>, "shall I <em>never</em> get any older than I am now? That'll be a
               comfort, one way—never to be an old woman—but then—always to have lessons to learn!
               Oh, I
               shouldn't like <em>that</em>!" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Oh, you foolish <span class="character">Alice</span>!" she said again, "how can you learn lessons in here? Why, there's
               hardly room for you, and no room at all for any lesson-books!" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> And so she went on, taking first one side, and then the other, and making quite a
               conversation of it altogether, but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside,
               which made
               her stop to listen. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Mary Ann! Mary Ann!" said the voice, "fetch me my gloves this moment!" Then came
               a little
               pattering of feet on the stairs: <span class="character">Alice</span> knew it was <span class="character">rabbit</span> coming to look for her, and she
               trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand
               times as
               large as <span class="character">rabbit</span>, and had no reason to be afraid of it. Presently <span class="character">rabbit</span> came to the
               door, and tried to open it, but as it opened inwards, and <span class="character">Alice</span>'s elbow was against it, the
               attempt proved a failure. <span class="character">Alice</span> heard it say to itself "then I'll go round and get in at the window." </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "<em>That</em> you wo'n't!" thought <span class="character">Alice</span>, and, after waiting till she fancied
               she heard <span class="character">rabbit</span>, just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a
               snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek
               and a fall
               and a crash of breaking glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible
               it had
               fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort. </div>
            
            
            <div class="p"> Next came an angry voice—<span class="character">rabbit</span>'s—"Pat, Pat! where are you?" And then a voice she had
               never heard before, "shure then I'm here! digging for apples, anyway, yer honour!"
               </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Digging for apples indeed!" said <span class="character">rabbit</span> angrily, "here, come and help me out of <em>this</em>!"—Sound of more breaking glass. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Now, tell me, Pat, what is that coming out of the window?" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Shure it's an arm, yer honour!" (He pronounced it "arrum".) </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "An arm, you goose! Who ever saw an arm that size? Why, it fills the whole window,
               don't you
               see?" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Shure, it does, yer honour, but it's an arm for all that." </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Well, it's no business there: go and take it away!" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> There was a long silence after this, and <span class="character">Alice</span> could only hear whispers now and then, such
               as "shure I don't like it, yer honour, at all at all!" "do as I tell you, you coward!"
               and at
               last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air. This time there
               were
               <em>two</em> little shrieks, and more breaking glass—"what a number of
               cucumber-frames there must be!" thought <span class="character">Alice</span>, "I wonder what they'll do next! As for pulling
               me out of the window, I only wish they <em>could</em>! I'm sure <em>I</em> don't want to stop in here any longer!" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of
               little cart-wheels, and
               the sound of a good many voices all talking together: she made out the words "where's
               the
               other ladder?—why, I hadn't to bring but one, <span class="character">Bill</span>'s got the other—here, put 'em up at this
               corner—no, tie 'em together first—they don't reach high enough yet—oh, they'll do
               well enough,
               don't be particular—here, <span class="character">Bill</span>! catch hold of this rope—will the roof bear?—mind that loose
               slate—oh, it's coming down! heads below!—" (a loud crash) "now, who did that?—it was
               <span class="character">Bill</span>, I
               fancy—who's to go down the chimney?—nay, <em>I</em> sha'n't! <em>you</em> do it!—<em>that</em> I won't then—<span class="character">Bill</span>'s got to go down—here,
               <span class="character">Bill</span>! the master says you've to go down the chimney!" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Oh, so <span class="character">Bill</span>'s got to come down the chimney, has he?" said <span class="character">Alice</span> to herself, "why, they seem
               to put everything upon <span class="character">Bill</span>! I wouldn't be in <span class="character">Bill</span>'s place for a good deal: the fireplace is a
               pretty tight one, but I <em>think</em> I can kick a little!" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till she heard
               a little animal (she
               couldn't guess what sort it was) scratching and scrambling in the chimney close above
               her:
               then, saying to herself "this is <span class="character">Bill</span>," she gave one sharp kick, and waited again to see what
               would happen next. </div>
            
            
            <div class="p"> The first thing was a general chorus of "there goes <span class="character">Bill</span>!" then <span class="character">rabbit</span>'s voice alone
               "catch him, you by the hedge!" then silence, and then another confusion of voices,
               "how was
               it, old fellow? what happened to you? tell us all about it." </div>
            
            <div class="p"> Last came a little feeble squeaking voice, ("that's <span class="character">Bill</span>" thought <span class="character">Alice</span>,) which said "well,
               I hardly know—I'm all of a fluster myself—something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box,
               and
               the next minute up I goes like a rocket!" "And so you did, old fellow!" said the other
               voices. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "We must burn the house down!" said the voice of <span class="character">rabbit</span>, and <span class="character">Alice</span> called out as loud as
               she could "if you do, I'll set <span class="character">Dinah</span> at you!" This caused silence again, and while <span class="character">Alice</span> was
               thinking "but how can I get <span class="character">Dinah</span> here?" she found to her great delight that she was getting
               smaller: very soon she was able to get up out of the uncomfortable position in which
               she had
               been lying, and in two or three minutes more she was once more three inches high. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> She ran out of the house as quick as she could, and found quite a crowd of little
               animals
               waiting outside—guinea-pigs, white mice, squirrels, and "<span class="character">Bill</span>" a little green lizard, that was
               being supported in the arms of one of the guinea-pigs, while another was giving it
               something
               out of a bottle. They all made a rush at her the moment she appeared, but <span class="character">Alice</span> ran her
               hardest, and soon found herself in a thick wood. </div>
            
            
            </section>
         <section class="chapter">
            
            <h2 class="chapterHeading"> Chapter III </h2>
            
            <div class="p"> "The first thing I've got to do," said <span class="character">Alice</span> to herself, as she wandered about in the wood,
               "is to grow to my right size, and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely
               garden.
               I think that will be the best plan." </div>
            
            <div class="p"> It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged: the
               only
               difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it, and while
               she was
               peering anxiously among the trees round her, a little sharp bark just over her head
               made her
               look up in a great hurry. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> An enormous <span class="character">puppy</span> was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out
               one paw, trying to reach her: "poor thing!" said <span class="character">Alice</span> in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it, but
               she was terribly alarmed all the while at the thought that it might be hungry, in
               which case
               it would probably devour her in spite of all her coaxing. Hardly knowing what she
               did, she
               picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the <span class="character">puppy</span>: whereupon the <span class="character">puppy</span> jumped into
               the air off all its feet at once, and with a yelp of delight rushed at the stick,
               and made
               believe to worry it then <span class="character">Alice</span> dodged behind a great thistle to keep herself from being run
               over, and, the moment she appeared at the other side, the <span class="character">puppy</span> made another dart at the
               stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold: then <span class="character">Alice</span>, thinking it was very
               like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled
               under
               its feet, ran round the thistle again: then the <span class="character">puppy</span> begin a series of short charges at the
               stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking
               hoarsely
               all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging
               out
               of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> This seemed to <span class="character">Alice</span> a good opportunity for making her escape. She set off at once, and ran
               till the <span class="character">puppy</span>'s bark sounded quite faint in the distance, and till she was quite tired and
               out of breath. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "And yet what a dear little <span class="character">puppy</span> it was!" said <span class="character">Alice</span>, as she leant against a buttercup to
               rest herself, and fanned herself with her hat. "I should have liked teaching it tricks,
               if—if
               I'd only been the right size to do it! Oh! I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow
               up
               again! Let me see; how is it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or drink something
               or other, but the great question is what?" </div> 
            
            <div class="p"> The great question certainly was, what? <span class="character">Alice</span> looked all round her at the flowers and the
               blades of grass but could not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat
               under the
               circumstances. There was a large mushroom near her, about the same height as herself,
               and when
               she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her
               to look
               and see what was on the top of it. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and
               her eyes immediately met
               those of a large blue <span class="character">caterpillar</span>, which was sitting with its arms folded, quietly smoking a
               long hookah, and taking not the least notice of her or of anything else. </div>
            
            
            <div class="p"> For some time they looked at each other in silence: at last the <span class="character">caterpillar</span> took the hookah
               out of its mouth, and languidly addressed her. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Who are you?" said the <span class="character">caterpillar</span>. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation: <span class="character">Alice</span> replied rather shyly, "I—I
               hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know who I was when I got up this morning,
               but I
               think I must have been changed several times since that." </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "What do you mean by that?" said the <span class="character">caterpillar</span>, "explain yourself!" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "I ca'n't explain <em>myself</em>, I'm afraid, sir," said <span class="character">Alice</span>, "because I'm not myself, you see." </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "I don't see," said the <span class="character">caterpillar</span>. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly," <span class="character">Alice</span> replied very politely, "for I ca'n't
               understand it myself, and really to be so many different sizes in one day is very
               confusing." </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "It isn't," said the <span class="character">caterpillar</span>. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet," said <span class="character">Alice</span>, "but when you have to turn into a
               chrysalis, you know, and then after that into a butterfly, I should think it'll feel
               a little
               queer, don't you think so?" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Not a bit," said the <span class="character">caterpillar</span>. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "All I know is," said <span class="character">Alice</span>, "it would feel queer to <em>me</em>." </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "<em>You</em>!" said the <span class="character">caterpillar</span> contemptuously, "who are you?" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation: <span class="character">Alice</span> felt a little
               irritated at the <span class="character">caterpillar</span> making such very short remarks, and she drew herself up and said
               very gravely "I think you ought to tell me who <em>you</em> are, first." </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Why?" said the <span class="character">caterpillar</span>. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> Here was another puzzling question: and as <span class="character">Alice</span> had no reason ready, and the <span class="character">caterpillar</span> seemed to be in a
               very bad temper, she turned round and walked away. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Come back!" the <span class="character">caterpillar</span> called after her, "I've something important to say!" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> This sounded promising: <span class="character">Alice</span> turned and came back again. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Keep your temper," said the <span class="character">caterpillar</span>. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Is that all?" said <span class="character">Alice</span>, swallowing down her anger as well as she could. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "No," said the <span class="character">caterpillar</span>. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> <span class="character">Alice</span> thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after

            <div class="p"> "It is a very good height indeed!" said the <span class="character">caterpillar</span> loudly and angrily, rearing itself
               straight up as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high). </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "But I'm not used to it!" pleaded poor <span class="character">Alice</span> in a piteous tone, and she thought to herself

            <div class="p"> "You'll get used to it in time," said the <span class="character">caterpillar</span>, and it put the hookah into its mouth,
               and began smoking again. </div> 
            
            <div class="p"> This time <span class="character">Alice</span> waited quietly until it chose to speak again: in a few minutes the
               <span class="character">caterpillar</span> took the hookah out of its mouth, and got down off the mushroom, and crawled away
               into the grass, merely remarking as it went; "the top will make you grow taller, and
               the stalk
               will make you grow shorter." </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "The top of <em>what</em>? the stalk of <em>what</em>?" thought
               <span class="character">Alice</span>. </div>
            
            
            <div class="p"> "Of the mushroom," said the <span class="character">caterpillar</span>, just as if she had asked it aloud, and in another
               moment was out of sight. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> <span class="character">Alice</span> remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, and then picked it and
               carefully broke it in two, taking the stalk in one hand, and the top in the other.
               </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "<em>Which</em> does the stalk do?" she said, and nibbled a little bit of it
               to try; the next moment she felt a violent blow on her chin: it had struck her foot!
               </div>
            
            <div class="p"> She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but as she did not shrink
               any
               further, and had not dropped the top of the mushroom, she did not give up hope yet.
               There was
               hardly room to open her mouth, with her chin pressing against her foot, but she did
               it at
               last, and managed to bite off a little bit of the top of the mushroom. </div>
            
            
            <div class="p"> "Come! my head's free at last!" said <span class="character">Alice</span> in a tone of delight, which changed into alarm in
               another moment, when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be seen: she looked
               down
               upon an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of
               green leaves
               that lay far below her. </div>
              
            
            <div class="p"> "What <em>can</em> all that green stuff be?" said <span class="character">Alice</span>, "and where <em>have</em> my shoulders got to? And oh! my poor hands! how is it I ca'n't see
               you?" She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except
               a little
               rustling among the leaves. Then she tried to bring her head down to her hands, and
               was
               delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in every direction, like a
               serpent.
               She had just succeeded in bending it down in a beautiful zig-zag, and was going to
               dive in
               among the leaves, which she found to be the tops of the trees of the wood she had
               been
               wandering in, when a sharp hiss made her draw back: a large <span class="character">pigeon</span> had flown into her face,
               and was violently beating her with its wings. </div>
            
            
            <div class="p"> "Serpent!" screamed the <span class="character">pigeon</span>. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "I'm <em>not</em> a serpent!" said <span class="character">Alice</span> indignantly, "let me alone!" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "I've tried every way!" the <span class="character">pigeon</span> said desperately, with a kind of sob: "nothing seems to
               suit 'em!" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "I haven't the least idea what you mean," said <span class="character">Alice</span>. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried hedges," the
               <span class="character">pigeon</span>
               went on without attending to her, "but them serpents! There's no pleasing 'em!" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> <span class="character">Alice</span> was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything till
               the <span class="character">pigeon</span> had finished. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs!" said the <span class="character">pigeon</span>, "without being on the
               look out for serpents, day and night! Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three
               weeks!" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "I'm very sorry you've been annoyed," said <span class="character">Alice</span>, beginning to see its meaning. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood," said the <span class="character">pigeon</span> raising its voice to a
               shriek, "and was just thinking I was free of 'em at last, they must needs come down
               from the
               sky! Ugh! Serpent!" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "But I'm <em>not</em> a serpent," said <span class="character">Alice</span>, "I'm a—I'm a—" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Well! <em>What</em> are you?" said the <span class="character">pigeon</span>, "I see you're trying to invent
               something." </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "I—I'm a little girl," said <span class="character">Alice</span>, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of
               changes she had gone through. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "A likely story indeed!" said the <span class="character">pigeon</span>, "I've seen a good many of them in my time, but
               never <em>one</em> with such a neck as yours! No, you're a serpent, I know <em>that</em> well enough! I suppose you'll tell me next that you never tasted an
               egg!" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "I <em>have</em> tasted eggs, certainly," said <span class="character">Alice</span>, who was a very truthful
               child, "but indeed I do'n't want any of yours. I do'n't like them raw." </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Well, be off, then!" said the <span class="character">pigeon</span>, and settled down into its nest again. <span class="character">Alice</span> crouched
               down among the trees, as well as she could, as her neck kept getting entangled among
               the
               branches, and several times she had to stop and untwist it. Soon she remembered the
               pieces of
               mushroom which she still held in her hands, and set to work very carefully, nibbling
               first at
               one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until
               she had
               succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual size. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> It was so long since she had been of the right size that it felt quite strange at
               first, but she got quite
               used to it in a minute or two, and began talking to herself as usual: "well! there's
               half my
               plan done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm going to
               be, from
               one minute to another! However, I've got to my right size again: the next thing is,
               to get
               into that beautiful garden—how <em>is</em> that to be done, I wonder?" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a doorway leading right
               into
               it. "That's very curious!" she thought, "but everything's curious today: I may as
               well go in."
               And in she went. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little glass table:
               "now,
               I'll manage better this time" she said to herself, and began by taking the little
               golden key,
               and unlocking the door that led into the garden. Then she set to work eating the pieces
               of
               mushroom till she was about fifteen inches high: then she walked down the little passage:
               and
               <em>then</em>—she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the
               bright flowerbeds and the cool fountains. </div>

            <div class="p"> <span class="character">Five</span> and <span class="character">Seven</span> looked at <span class="character">Two</span>, but said nothing: Two began, in a low voice, "why, Miss, the
               fact is, this ought to have been a red rose tree, and we put a white one in by mistake,
               and if
               the <span class="character">Queen</span> was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off. So, you see, we're doing
               our best, before she comes, to—" At this moment <span class="character">Five</span>, who had been looking anxiously across
               the garden called out "the <span class="character">Queen</span>! the <span class="character">Queen</span>!" and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon
               their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to
               see the <span class="character">
                  Queen</span>. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners,
               flat
               and oblong, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these
               were all
               ornamented with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these
               came the
               Royal children: there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily
               along, hand
               in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly
               kings
               and queens, among whom <span class="character">Alice</span> recognised the white <span class="character">rabbit</span>: it was talking in a hurried nervous
               manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her. Then
               followed
               the <span class="character">Knave</span> of Hearts, carrying the King's crown on a cushion, and, last of all this grand
               procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS. </div>
            
            
            <div class="p"> When the procession came opposite to <span class="character">Alice</span>, they all stopped and looked at her, and the <span class="character">Queen</span> said severely "who
               is this?" She said it to the <span class="character">Knave</span> of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Idiot!" said the <span class="character">Queen</span>, turning up her nose, and asked Alice "what's your name?" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "My name is <span class="character">Alice</span>, so please your Majesty," said <span class="character">Alice</span> boldly, for she thought to herself
               "why, they're only a pack of cards! I needn't be afraid of them!" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Who are these?" said the <span class="character">Queen</span>, pointing to the<span class="character">three gardeners</span> lying round the rose tree,
               for, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same
               as the
               rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or
               courtiers,
               or three of her own children. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "How should <em>I</em> know?" said <span class="character">Alice</span>, surprised at her own courage, "it's
               no business of <em>mine</em>." </div>
            
            <div class="p"> The <span class="character">Queen</span>turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a minute, began in a voice
               of thunder "off with her—" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Nonsense!" said <span class="character">Alice</span>, very loudly and decidedly, and the <span class="character">Queen</span> was silent. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> the <span class="character">King</span> laid his hand upon her arm, and said timidly "remember, my dear! She is only a
               child!" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> the <span class="character">Queen</span> turned angrily away from him, and said to the <span class="character">Knave</span> "turn them over!" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> The <span class="character">Knave</span> did so, very carefully, with one foot. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Get up!" said the <span class="character">Queen</span>, in a shrill loud voice, and the <span class="character">three gardeners</span> instantly jumped
               up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen, the Royal children, and everybody else.
               </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Leave off that!" screamed the <span class="character">Queen</span>, "you make me giddy." And then, turning to the rose
               tree, she went on "what <em>have</em> you been doing here?" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "May it please your Majesty," said Two very humbly, going down on one knee as he
               spoke, "we were trying—" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "I see!" said the <span class="character">Queen</span>, who had meantime been examining the roses, "off with their heads!"
               and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the
               three
               unfortunate gardeners, who ran to <span class="character">Alice</span> for protection. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "You sha'n't be beheaded!" said <span class="character">Alice</span>, and she put them into her pocket: the <span class="character">three soldiers</span>
               marched once round her, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the others.
               </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Are their heads off?" shouted the <span class="character">Queen</span>. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Their heads are gone," the <span class="character">soldiers</span> shouted in reply, "if it please your Majesty!" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "That's right!" shouted the <span class="character">Queen</span>, "can you play croquet?" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> The <span class="character">soldiers </span> were silent, and looked at <span class="character">Alice</span>, as the question was evidently meant for her. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Yes!" shouted <span class="character">Alice</span> at the top of her voice. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Come on then!" roared the <span class="character">Queen</span>, and <span class="character">Alice</span> joined the procession, wondering very much what
               would happen next. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "It's—it's a very fine day!" said a timid little voice: she was walking by the white
               rabbit,
               who was peeping anxiously into her face. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Very," said <span class="character">Alice</span>, "where's the Marchioness?" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Hush, hush!" said the <span class="character">rabbit</span> in a low voice, "she'll hear you. The Queen's the Marchioness:
               didn't you know that?" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "No, I didn't," said <span class="character">Alice</span>, "what of?" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Queen of Hearts," said the <span class="character">rabbit</span> in a whisper, putting its mouth close to her ear, "and
               Marchioness of <span class="character">Mock Turtles</span>." </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "What are <em>they</em>?" said <span class="character">Alice</span>, but there was no time for the answer,
               for they had reached the croquet-ground, and the game began instantly. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> <span class="character">Alice</span> thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in all her life: it was
               all
               in ridges and furrows: the croquet-balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live ostriches,
               and
               the soldiers had to double themselves up, and stand on their feet and hands, to make
               the arches. </div>
            
            
            <div class="p"> The chief difficulty which <span class="character">Alice</span> found at first was to manage her ostrich: she got its body
               tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally,
               just as she had got its neck straightened out nicely, and was going to give a blow
               with its
               head, it <em>would</em> twist itself round, and look up into her face, with such
               a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had
               got its
               head down, and was going to begin again, it was very confusing to find that the hedgehog
               had
               unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was
               generally a
               ridge or a furrow in her way, wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and as
               the
               doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground,
               <span class="character">Alice</span> soon came to the
               conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed. </div>
            
            
            <div class="p"> The players all played at once without waiting for turns, and quarrelled all the
               while at
               the tops of their voices, and in a very few minutes the <span class="character">Queen</span> was in a furious passion, and
               went stamping about and shouting "off with his head!" of "off with her head!" about
               once in a
               minute. All those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who
               of course
               had to leave off being arches to do this, so that, by the end of half an hour or so,
               there
               were no arches left, and all the players, except the <span class="character">King</span>, the <span class="character">Queen</span>, and <span class="character">Alice</span>, were in
               custody, and under sentence of execution. </div>
            
            
            <div class="p"> The <span class="character">King</span> and <span class="character">Queen</span> were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a great crowd
               assembled around them: the <span class="character">Knave</span> was in custody: and before the <span class="character">King</span> stood the white <span class="character">rabbit</span>,
               with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. </div>
            
            
            <div class="p"> "Herald! read the accusation!" said the <span class="character">King</span>. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> On this the white <span class="character">rabbit</span>blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment
               scroll, and read as follows: </div>
            
            <div class="poem">
               
               <div class="stanza">
                  "The Queen of Hearts she made some tarts
                  All on a summer day:
                  The <span class="character">Knave</span> of Hearts he stole those tarts,
                  And took them quite away!"
                  </div>
               </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Now for the evidence," said the <span class="character">King</span>, "and then the sentence." </div>
            
            
            <div class="p"> "No!" said the <span class="character">Queen</span>, "first the sentence, and then the evidence!" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Nonsense!" cried <span class="character">Alice</span>, so loudly that everybody jumped, "the idea of having the sentence
               first!" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Hold your tongue!" said the <span class="character">Queen</span>. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "I won't!" said <span class="character">Alice</span>, "you're nothing but a pack of cards! Who cares for you?" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she gave
               a
               little scream of fright, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the
               bank, with
               her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some leaves that had
               fluttered
               down from the trees on to her face. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Wake up! <span class="character">Alice</span> dear!" said her sister, "what a nice long sleep you've had!" </div>
            
            <div class="p"> "Oh, I've had such a curious dream!" said <span class="character">Alice</span>, and she told her sister all her Adventures
               Under Ground, as you have read them, and when she had finished, her sister kissed
               her and said
               "it <em>was</em> a curious dream, dear, certainly! But now run in to your tea:
               it's getting late." </div>
            
            <div class="p"> So <span class="character">Alice</span> ran off, thinking while she ran (as well she might) what a wonderful dream it had
               been. </div>
            
            
            <div class="p"> But her sister sat there some while longer, watching the setting sun, and thinking
               of little
               <span class="character">Alice</span> and her Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her
               dream: </div>
            
            <div class="p"> She saw an ancient city, and a quiet river winding near it along the plain, and up
               the
               stream went slowly gliding a boat with a merry party of children on board—she could
               hear their
               voices and laughter like music over the water—and among them was another little <span class="character">Alice</span>, who sat
               listening with bright eager eyes to a tale that was being told, and she listened for
               the words
               of the tale, and lo! it was the dream of her own little sister. So the boat wound
               slowly along, beneath the
               bright summer-day, with its merry crew and its music of voices and laughter, till
               it passed
               round one of the many turnings of the stream, and she saw it no more. </div>
            
            <div class="p"> Then she thought, (in a dream within the dream, as it were,) how this same little
               <span class="character">Alice</span>
               would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman: and how she would keep, through
               her riper
               years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather around
               her other
               little children, and make <em>their</em> eyes bright and eager with many a
               wonderful tale, perhaps even with these very adventures of the little <span class="character">Alice</span> of long-ago: and
               how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their
               simple
               joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days. </div>
